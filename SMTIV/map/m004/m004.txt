0: (Ring of Gaea man) ...Who are you? You don't seem to be
one of the Ring of Gaea.
[->]Well, regardless, try to stay out of
our way. If you cannot, then we'll slay
you before dealing with Xi Wangmu.
[END]
1: (Ring of Gaea woman) Odd that you'd come to Ikebukuro now.
Do you have family or loved ones here?
[->]This may sound harsh, but don't get
your hopes up. Ikebukuro's underground
has been overrun by demons.
[END]
2: 〉 You have no more business here.
[END]
3: (Greedy Hunter) [13 1, 403013]Whaddaya want!? Don't come over here!
[->]The treasure around here's all mine.
[->]I'm gonna grab every last one!
[END]
14: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403001]H−Hey... I saw some people in red come
down from the Metropolitan Expressway...
[->]Y'think they were part of that Ring of
Gaea? They went towards Sunshine...
[END]
15: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403001]I just saw someone in a strange black
outfit, heading towards the underground
district...
[->]Huh? You want to know how to get to
the underground district?
[->]Well, first you take the southwest exit
out. Northwest from there is the other
entrance into the city.
[->]Go in from there and you can't miss it.
[END]
17: (Ring of Gaea man) [13 1, 404311]The demon's nest is up ahead. Kaga seems
to have gone in already...
[->]Even if we send many against it, it is
a great foreign demon. In truth, we have
nearly no chance against it...
[->]But if it inspires the people to see
us take a stand against the demon,
then that is enough.
[END]
18: 〉 There's no one here...
[END]
19: (Hunter man) That big building there is called
Sunshine. It's always had a shady
history, even back then...
[END]
