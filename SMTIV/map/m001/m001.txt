aboveground. You are responsible for
your own actions.”
[->]〉 ...So the mystic script says.
[END]
11: (Hunter man) I got myself a supply of demon meat
today as well. Now I can feed everyone.
[END]
12: (Hunter man) I killed tons of demons today too!
It really gets the blood pumping.
[END]
13: (Hunter man) The demons are everyone's common enemy.
Let's you and me show those bastards
what a Hunter's got.
[END]
14: (Young man) Ack! Is that... Is that demon blood
on you...?
[END]
15: (Young man) I'm not crazy about those Ashura−kai
people... They scare me out of my mind!
[END]
16: (Hunter man) Are you a Hunter too? Don't even think
about taking my jobs.
[END]
17: (Hunter man) We've gotta be armed to the teeth to
fight against demons.
[END]
18: (Friendly Hunter) [13 1, 403002]Hey there. You're a Hunter, right?
[->]I'm glad to see you here, because I'm
in the market for some food.
[->][13 1, 403042]Let's see... Do you have any
[Color:0x5][Item 1]?[Color:0x0]
[->]I'd buy [Color:0x5][Item 1][Color:0x0] for triple
the market price right now.
[END]
19: 〉 Hand over your [Color:0x5][Item 1]?[Color:0x0]
[END]
20: Yes
No
[END]
21: (Friendly Hunter) [13 1, 403041]I can't thank you enough. Here's the
[Color:0x5][Amount 1] Macca[Color:0x0] I owe you.
[END]
22: (Friendly Hunter) [13 1, 403033]I hope you'll be around to help me out
again in a bit.
[END]
23: (Friendly Hunter) [13 1, 403042]Oh. Well, that's okay. If you ever
change your mind, you know where
to find me.
[END]
24: (Friendly Hunter) [13 1, 403042]Hm? You don't have any [Item 1].
[->]Oops. Sorry if that was an unreasonable
request.
[END]
25: (Friendly Hunter) [7a 29][13 1, 403001]I've got plenty of food right now. But
if you come back another time, maybe
we can do business then.
[END]
26: (Greedy Hunter) [7a 29][13 1, 403013]Whaddaya want!? Don't come over here!
[->]The treasure around here's all mine.
[->]I'm gonna grab every last one!
[END]
27: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]I do quests to make a living... Reminds
me of the days I used to work in bars.
[END]
28: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403031]I never thought I could sleep out on
the streets, but you get used to it.
Haha...
[END]
29: (Young man) [13 1, 403012]Walking's a pain, but that's all I can
think of doing...
[END]
30: (Young man) [13 1, 403421]What's ”morning”? When the sky is bright?
...You're not making any sense here.
[END]
31: This area still has echoes of what it
was like in the past. The Golden Gai
was known for its bars.
[END]
32: Some stores around here even turned away
average customers. I wonder where the
people who were here have gone...
[END]
33: There was a time long ago that this
place was a farm. Strange, isn't it,
that it was in the middle of a city?
[END]
34: The household electronics stores stand
out on the west entrance side. No buses
have shown up here in a while, either.
[END]
35: This place is probably best known for
the Shinjuku Niagara Falls. The people
who used to sleep here are gone now too.
[END]
36: I think this area had a lot of office
buildings. Have you ever gotten lost
here in the urban sprawl?
[END]
37: Underground Shinjuku is supposedly like
a labyrinth. There's a lot more people
there, compared to other places.
[END]
38: This place was once bustling with
customers. The map doesn't give a good
sense of how extensive it is...
[END]
39: This passage seems to stretch all the
way to the Metropolitan Government
Office. It's pretty dusty around here.
[END]
40: I didn't have any data on this passage.
Looks like there aren't any stores here.
[END]
41: (Heavily accented man) [13 0, 94004]Huh? What's that? Ya want me to let
ya past here?
[->][13 0, 94005]Sorry, ain't happenin'. I do that,
and the demons on the other
side'll get through.
[END]
42: (Heavily accented man) [13 0, 94006]That thing with the Corpses ain't
over yet either. I don't got time to
worry about the west side right now.
[END]
43: (Burroughs) [13 0, 400063]Looks like the quest is going well.
[END]
44: (Heavily accented man) [13 0, 94007]Huh? What's that? Ya want me to let
ya past here?
[->][13 0, 94008]Sorry, ain't happenin'. I do that,
and the demons out on the other
side'll get through.
[END]
45: (Heavily accented man) [13 0, 94009]That is, unless you help out with
defeatin' that monster at the
Metropolitan Government Office... Huh?
[->][13 0, 94010]Some Jirae demon's occupied the place
and it's givin' us a huge headache.
[->][13 0, 94011]We'll give ya the Jirae Talisman we
stole from it as a reward. Whaddaya
say? Will ya off it for us?
[END]
46: Off it
Don't off it
[END]
47: (Heavily accented man) [13 0, 94012]Heh, that'd be nice.
[->][13 0, 94013]One of our boys went on ahead with
some hired Hunters. The more the
better, they say.
[END]
48: (Burroughs) [13 1, 400050]I'll register that as a new quest
on the list.
[END]
49: (Heavily accented man) [13 0, 94015]You're free to pass now, so I'll be
countin' on you to deal with that demon
at the Metropolitan Government Office.
[END]
50: 〉 There's a switch.
Push it?
[END]
51: Push it
Don't do anything
[END]
52: (Heavily accented man) [13 0, 94016]Geez, what a stiff. All of us here in
Shinjuku are havin' a hard time 'cause
of that thing, ya know.
[->][13 0, 94017]Alright, I got no business with
ya, then. Take a hike.
[END]
53: 〉 The Ashura−kai man opened the shutter
and left.
