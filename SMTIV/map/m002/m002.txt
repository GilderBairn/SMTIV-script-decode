101: (Hunter man) 500,000 people supposedly walked here
once. It feels odd, seeing it so empty.
[END]
102: (Hunter man) All these hills must have been rough to
walk up and down, but this area used to
be a crowded shopping district.
[END]
103: (Hunter man) My job this time was a breeze. I made
a bundle on it.
[END]
104: (Hunter man) When the trains came in, people would
gather to the buses. Back when trains,
people, and buses were still here.
[END]
105: (Young woman) [13 1, 403122]I heard people used to go on ”diets.”
Which makes it sound like there used to
be plenty of food to go around...
[END]
106: (Young woman) [13 1, 403121]It's cold because there's no sun
outside... I can't let go of my coat.
[END]
107: (Young man) [13 1, 403421]Hey, I'm making my rounds here! Outta
the way! I got connections in the Ashura−
kai, y'know!
[END]
108: (Young man) [13 1, 403002]Isn't this leather jacket awesome?
I found it in a store I raided.
[END]
109: (Boy) [13 1, 404001]It's no use ”kidnapping” me. My family
couldn't pay the ”ransom” thingy.
[END]
110: (Young woman) [13 1, 403312]My husband is out hunting, so I need
to look for things I can trade for
some cash too...
[END]
111: (Girl) [13 1, 404121]If I were a boy, I could be a Hunter...
My daddy says I can't, because it's too
dangerous.
[END]
112: (Young woman) [13 1, 403542]Smartphone? Not interested. That's those
machines with demons in them, right?
[END]
113: (Young woman) Why are the Ashura−kai people so
stuck up?
[END]
114: (Young man) There's this sign that says ”Free
Information Hall” at Dogenzaka... I don't
know what that means, but I'm curious.
[END]
213: (Young woman) It's fine that the Ashura−kai are gone...
but who's going to protect us now?
[END]
214: (Young man) If we didn't have the Ashura−kai,
we could come under demon attack at
any time.
