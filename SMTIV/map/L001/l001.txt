[END]
25: (Guide) [13 1, 403001]You must be a rookie Hunter. Do you
want some help?
[->]I can tell you what I know.
Like where Shinjuku, Tokyo Station,
and Kasumigaseki are.
[END]
26: (Ashura−kai Man) Whoa, hold it right there. No one's
allowed in.
[->]And don't go getting any dumb ideas
like sneaking around looking for
a way in, either.
[END]
27: (Ashura−kai man) Those Ring of Gaea punks... They're...
really serious this time...
[->]They brought... a ridiculously strong
troop...
[->]You guys... Are you gonna... go help out
Mr. Tayama...?
[->]Camp Ichigaya... is up ahead... Y−You
better hurry...
[END]
28: (Dreary man) [13 1, 403012]I used to take walks across Ryogokubashi
up ahead to Kasumigaseki...
[->]But the bridge is out and these weird
demons are there now... I wonder if
I'll ever see Kasumigaseki again.
[END]
29: (Armed man) [13 1, 403021]...Hey, don't think about mooching off
of me. I'm not sharing my hard−earned
items or Macca with you.
[->]Why don't you head a little more west
to Ueno and find a sucker to
give you something there?
[END]
30: (Armed man) [13 1, 403002]Did you come looking for a smartphone in
Akihabara too? Then you wasted your time.
[->]It's worse than what you might have
heard. Nothing's left there. They say
it was blown away in a military strike.
[->]The Ashura−kai will wipe a whole city
off the map for their purposes...
Another reminder of their awfulness.
[END]
31: (Ashura−kai man) [13 1, 404311]Mr. Tayama told me not to let any
strange guys go to Shibuya.
[->]So I gotta ask you to leave. Seeya.
[END]
32: (Ashura−kai man) [13 1, 404311]Mr. Tayama told me it was okay for the
Samurai to go through.
[->]So you're free to go on ahead.
[END]
33: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 0, 76036]I'm detecting a strong demon ahead.
Do you want to go on?
[END]
34: Yes
No
[END]
35: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403023]Dammit, I can't find any...! There's
gotta be at least one Red somewhere
on the ground!
[->]If that goddamn demon wasn't shitting
up the place in Shibuya, I wouldn't
have to go through all this trouble!

37: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403101]East from here is the Roppongi region.
It's where Shibuya and Roppongi are...
[->]Supposedly you can only get there
through an underground passage, but
I couldn't tell you where it is.
[END]
38: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]That Tayama seems serious this time.
I heard he's gonna start an all−out war
against the Ring of Gaea.
[->]I've heard he put some ”national defense
weapon” at the Sendagaya Tunnel ahead.
[->]I went to take a peek and almost soiled
my drawers when I saw that demon!
[END]
39: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]That Tayama seems serious this time.
I heard he's gonna start an all−out war

[->]I've heard he put some ”national defense
weapon” at the Sendagaya Tunnel ahead.
[->]There was a guy a moment ago saying he
was going to Ichigaya. I hate to say it,
but he's probably dead now...
[END]
40: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403142]You want to go to the west entrance
park? I suggest you rethink that.
[->]The Ashura−kai's sealed off the west
side of Shinjuku. If you go in that
way, they'd take it personally...
[->]If you have business in Shinjuku, why
not go in from the south entrance?
[END]
41: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403012]The Ashura−kai posted some quest with
the Association in Shinjuku.
[->]I came all this way through the subway
tunnels from Ikebukuro, hoping to snag
it for myself...
[->]But now I have to walk through that
poisonous swamp too?
[END]
42: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403112]Bleh... If I could use the Terminals,
I wouldn't have to deal with this
poisonous swamp.
[->]But I'm almost at Shinjuku... I can see
the skyscrapers in the south.
[END]
43: (Skulking man) [13 1, 403222]I−I'm just taking a walk around here...
but don't tell anyone, okay?
[->]If all goes well, there's something in
it for you. I'll share the vegetables
grown in the National Park with you...
[END]
44: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403021]I know there's no point, but I keep
heading toward Shibuya...
[->]Even if I go over there, the Ashura−kai
will just shoo me away.
[END]
45: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403021]I know there's no point, but I keep
heading toward Shibuya...
[->]If Tayama calls me up, would I be able
to get into Shibuya again then...?

a minute ago, saying there were some
kinda vanguard...
[->]There's no way they coulda stood up to
Koga Saburo. Thanks to them, I'm stuck
with the job of cleaning up the bodies.
[->]Say... are you guys new here? Then do
me a solid and stand guard over there.

1039: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]Over at the Sendagaya Tunnel up ahead,
there's this weird mound of rock.
[->]Is that the place where... ”Koga Saburo”,
his name was?
[->]He was that really strong demon Tayama
put there, right?
[END]
1125: (Guide) Head north a bit and you'll find
a ferryman. Ask him to take you to
Shinjuku.
[->]Anything else you wanna ask?
