0: (Mother Harlot) Ha! To think the someone would
willingly chase after a demon...
A foolish decision, for a warrior.
[->]I do respect your determination,
however.
[->]If you wish to challenge me, then
so be it. I will face you!

defeated...?

showed up...
[->]You've ruined everything...
[END]

My dreams, my paradise...
[->]I haven't given up yet!
You hear me!?
[END]
4: 〉 The people who have gathered for
the ritual disperse...
[END]
5: (Pales) [7a 65410]I was concerned when I realized
that the ritual had been completed.
[->]But, you have done well.
Mother Harlot has been defeated.
[->]Now we can maintain a peaceful
balance between humans and demons
in this world.
[->]Who knew that a human would be
capable of such things...?
[->]It seems that I have misjudged your
people.
[->]In any case, good work, [Flynn].
