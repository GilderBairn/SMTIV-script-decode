0: (Wu Kong) [7a 0][13 1, 411005]Who the hell are you?
[->]Wait a minute, you were sent to find
me, weren't you?
[END]
1: (Wu Kong) [7a 0][13 1, 411009]Damn it... I bet Erlang Shen put you
up to this, didn't he?
[END]
2: (Wu Kong) [7a 0][13 1, 411007]Heh, yeah, right.
It was Erlang Shen, wasn't it?
[->]I'm guessing that he's asked you to
capture me and take me back.
[END]
3: (Wu Kong) ...But from the looks of things, he
still doesn't know about this place.
[->]Well then, there's only one thing
to do.
[->]I'll just have to silence you, and
then I can keep hiding here for a
while longer.
[END]
4: (Wu Kong) [7a 0][13 1, 411006]Not bad...! Guess I'll just have to
scram for now.
[->]Bye now!

5: ã€‰ The demon runs away...

6: Yes
No
