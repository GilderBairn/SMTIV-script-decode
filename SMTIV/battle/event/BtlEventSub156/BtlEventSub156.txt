0: (Tiamat) [7a 0][13 1, 419005]I find it difficult to comprehend
why all of you would want to
participate in something like this.
[->]...Unlike you, I have no choice. I
was summoned and ordered to do this.
[->]Really, I would prefer not to take
part in such trash, but what can you
do. Let's get this over with.
[END]
1: (Tiamat) [7a 0][13 1, 419004]You're pretty good.
[->]I wouldn't have thought that I would
be defeated.
[END]
2: (Tiamat) [7a 0][13 1, 419001]Would you be [Flynn], by any
chance?
[->]I thought so...
[->]The Ashura−kai, the group that set
up this project, were pretty wary
about having you participate.
[->]Hahaha... Things have certainly
gotten interesting.

[->]I thought so...
[->]The Ashura−kai, the group that set
up this project, were pretty wary
about having you participate.
[->]I hear you played a large part in
why the Ashura−kai fell apart.
[->]No wonder...
[->]Even after the fall of the
Ashura−kai, humans still thirst for
entertainment...
[->]And I'm still here because my contract
stipulates that I must be on this
show.
[->]Sorry if I'm boring you with my
talking. I'll be on my way now.
