explanation of the battle system?
[->][END]
1: Listen to it
Don't listen to it
[END]
2: Your team's turn will now begin.
First, look at the upper right corner.
[->]The green icon displayed here shows the
[Color:0x5]number of times you can act this turn.[Color:0x0]
These icons are called [Color:0x5]Press Turn Icons.[Color:0x0]
[->]There is currently [Color:0x5]1[Color:0x0] icon, showing that
you can [Color:0x5]act once[Color:0x0] this turn. Select
[Color:0x5]Attack[Color:0x0] from the command list to attack
the enemy.
[END]
3: You succeeded in damaging the enemy.
[->]Look at the Press Turn Icon. The icon
that was there before has disappeared.
[->]One icon equates to one action, so using
that attack expended one icon.
[END]
4: [先/さき]ほどスライムに[攻撃/こうげき]したときとは[違/ちが]い
[緑/みどり]のアイコンが1[回/かい]の[攻撃/こうげき]で1[個/こ]
[消費/しょうひ]されました
[->][緑/みどり]のアイコンの[数/かず]が0になりましたので
[味方/みかた]が[行動/こうどう]できる[回数/かいすう]は[増/ふ]えることなく
[敵/てき]の[行動/こうどう]ターンが[開始/かいし]されます
[END]
5: You damaged the enemy and struck its
weakness as well.
[->]Look at the Press Turn Icon. It should
be shining brightly, indicating that
[Color:0x5]you can act once more.[Color:0x0]
[->]By attacking with [Color:0x5]an element the enemy
is weak against,[Color:0x0] a normal icon will begin
to shine and you can act once more.
[->]In this case, because [Color:0x5]the Slime was weak
to the Phys element[Color:0x0] of [Flynn]'s
normal attack, the icon shined and [Color:0x5]you
can act once more.[Color:0x0]
[->][END]
6: The number of Press Turn Icons has been
reduced to 0.
[->]You have no more icons showing your
number of actions, which ends your turn.
The enemy's turn will begin now.
[END]
7: Attacking the Slime was different from
attacking Lham Dearg in that you struck
its weakness and the Press Turn Icon
shined, allowing you to act again.
[->][Color:0x5]Striking enemy weaknesses to increase
the number of times you can act[Color:0x0] will be
the key to gaining the advantage in
battle.
[->]You struck a weakness with a normal
attack this time, but by gaining new
skills such as ice and electric attacks,
you can strike other weaknesses as well.
[->]Also, your actions can not only increase,
but [Color:0x5]decrease[Color:0x0] as well.
[->]When an [Color:0x5]attack misses or is nulled,[Color:0x0]
it will use more icons than normal,
decreasing your number of actions.
[->]This rule applies to the enemy's actions
as well.
[->]If the enemy strikes your weakness, [Color:0x5]it
will gain actions,[Color:0x0] while if the enemy's
attack is evaded or nulled, [Color:0x5]you can
cause the enemy to lose actions.[Color:0x0]
[->]That sums up the basic flow of battle.
Concentrate on [Color:0x5]both sides' weaknesses and
remaining Press Turns[Color:0x0] to take control of
the tide of battle.
[->][END]
8: (Demon) [13 1, 413204]A human... A human is here!
[->]You never learn. You were a fool to
venture into our nest of evil.
[->]I hope you are prepared to die at
the hands of a demon!
