[->]Seed of chaos... ripen further... lead
this world... into further chaos...
[->]When the next harvest arrives... then
you shall... see me again...
[END]
1000: (Sanat) Yes, this power... Evolve and grow
stronger still.
[->]Then I shall take you to the stage of
the true war.
[->]You understand of which I speak, no...?
[END]
1001: ”The war for all possible futures.”
”The war for Earth.”
”I cannot imagine.”
[END]
1002: (Sanat) In comparison to the vastness of the
universe, a nation or two is but a
speck of dust.
[->]Your perspective is stunted indeed if
you adhere to such trifles.
[END]

existence...
[END]

existence...

1007: 〉 All of [Flynn]'s stats have
greatly decreased!

such a small planet?

over a hill...
[->]Your very nature is small and
insignificant...

existence...
[END]
1010: 〉 All of [Flynn]'s stats have
greatly decreased!
[END]
1011: (Sanat) Indeed not. It is nothing that any who
dwell on this planet could begin to
understand.
[->]But I shall tell you. The true war...
[->]It is the war to destroy the
dispensation of the universe!
[->]Now, I shall draw out your true power.
Concentrate on surpassing yourself...
[END]
1012: 〉 [Flynn] felt power welling up
from within...
