the lowly worms you are!

1: (Someone's voice) [7a 3][13 0, 300303]Hold it right there!
[END]
2: (Hooded man) [7a 31][13 0, 300304]What...!? Who's there!?
[END]
4: (Jonathan) [7a 3][13 0, 300305]I do believe we arrived just in time.
Are you all right, [Flynn]?
[END]
5: (Isabeau) [7a 5][13 0, 300306]We're here to assist you.
[END]
7: ã€‰ Jonathan and Isabeau join the battle!
[END]
8: (Hooded man) [7a 31][13 0, 300308]But you are both Luxurors! Why...!?
[->][13 0, 300309]Crush them, my minions!
[END]
10: (Hooded man) [7a 31][13 0, 300310]Impossible... How could you have
bested my horde...?
[->][13 0, 300311]Where did they find this year's
prentices...!?
[END]
12: (Isabeau) [7a 5][13 0, 300312]Prentices we may be, but we are
Samurai nonetheless. Your folly was
taking us so lightly.
[END]
13: (Jonathan) [7a 3][13 0, 300313]Prentice or master, Casualry or
Luxuror; it matters not to a
truly committed Samurai.
[->][13 0, 300314]Surely, you should understand...
as you, too, are among our number.
[END]
15: (Hooded man) [7a 31][13 0, 300315]......!
[->][13 0, 300316]They know... This is it...
[END]
105: (Isabeau) [7a 5][7b 131077, 65537][13 0, 300307]If you are going to use the strength
of numbers to overwhelm us, then we
shall counter with our own numbers.
