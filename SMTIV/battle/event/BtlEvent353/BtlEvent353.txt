0: (Gabriel) To think that you, one of the Lord's
chosen, would reject His outstretched
hand and fall in with demons...
[->]It seems that we erred in allowing you
to keep your Gauntlet...
[END]
10: (Gabriel) Nnngh...! What... horrifying power...!
[->]My Lord... Am I to be defeated here...?
[END]
11: 〉 A majestic voice echoes from
somewhere...
[END]
12: (Majestic voice) [7a 1]Gabriel... You have done all you can.
Now retreat.
[->]I, [Color:0x5]Michael,[Color:0x0] will take care of the rest.
[END]
13: 〉 A vicious, heated wind scorches the
area...
[END]
1000: (Gabriel) The Eastern Kingdom of Mikado is the
home of the new human race that has been
restored at the hands of the Lord.
[->]We cannot allow man to be corrupted by
the troublesome serpent's ideas again.
[->]Just as mankind fell and became the
Unclean Ones in the past...
[END]
1001: ”You are wrong.”
”It's not wrong.”
Remain silent
[END]
1002: (Gabriel) No, it is you who are in the wrong. You
need only look at Tokyo if it is evidence
you require.
[->]That city, having lost its glory and
light to descend into endless darkness,
overflows with violence and lust.
[->]How can man live an upright life in
such a land?
[END]
1003: 〉 Gabriel surges with murderous power...
[END]
1004: 〉 Gabriel gains the power to act more!
[END]
1005: (Gabriel) Indeed, we are correct. Simply look at
the pitiful state of Tokyo.
[->]Robbed of the Lord's glory and light,
they face eternal darkness.
[->]We must not let the same fate befall the
Eastern Kingdom of Mikado...
[END]
1006: 〉 Gabriel surges with murderous power...
[END]
1007: 〉 Gabriel gains the power to act more!
[END]
1008: (Gabriel) ...You need not say anything.
[->]You know that we are right, yet you
have been brainwashed by that ”raven,”
no?
[->]Ah, that vexing raven... he is a disgrace
to our order who leads our children
astray...!
[END]
1009: 〉 Gabriel is filled with such disgust
that you see an opening...
[END]
1010: 〉 Gabriel lost her chance to act!
[END]
1011: (Gabriel) That is why we will purify them. Can you
say that we are wrong to do so?
[END]
1012: (Gabriel) ...For the sake of all that is good in
man, the Filth must be annihilated.
[END]
