Nothin' doing!
Get back, boy!
Before I kill you!
That dirty face!

9: It's decided.
My contract...!
Here you go!
This, right?
Take it!

An offering!
It's good manners.
You get it...
Right, boy?

15: [71 1]Now that I get a good look at you,
I can see you've got one of my sisters

now, don't it! Make sure you take good
care of her.
[->][END]
16: [71 1]Want to ask another demon too, while
we're jawin'? Seeing as fate brought

another demon now.

Good for your karma!
I'll show you!
This'll be fun!

25: [71 1]You're a funny kid, asking a demon
to stop fighting.
[->]Well, all right. Depending on what you
offer me, I'll think about it.
[->][END]
26: Stop fighting?
What a silly boy!
Well, all right!
I'll think about it.
What've you got?

What's the catch?

You've got guts.
Y'better have some.

That's the basics.
Sheesh...
Now what...?
Honestly, boy.

137: He stopped...
Nice trick!
Pretty good...
For a human.
We give, we give.

A dirty trick!
We can't have that!
You'll be sorry!
We'll make you pay!

140: [71 1]Hahaha, you've got some sack, boy!
How many times are you going to turn
me down?
[->]Well, that's fine. You win, boy,
I give up.

141: Quite a spine!
You don't give up!
In that case...
We give up!
You win!

What a killjoy...
Giving in so soon...

Hahaha... What a pitiful boy.

Time to go.
Well then...
We'll be going.
Time to leave!

149: My...!
It's you again!
You don't mind?
Getting cozy...
With us demons!

150: [71 1]...I had a feeling that was it.
Everything is fated, after all.
[->][END]
151: A contract?
With us?
I see...
Well...
That's fated too.
[END]
152: [71 1]It does feel a touch awkward, fighting
someone I know...
[->]Let's not and say we did, hmm?
[->][END]
153: We feel...
The same!
It's decided!
Battle's over...
We'll call it off!

154: [71 1]Idle chitchat, hm? You have such
interesting ideas.
[->]That's the perfect way for a couple
of friends to pass the time!

I like it!
You're good!
Much better...
Than these demons!

156: [71 1]Asking to be taken care of the moment
we meet? Well, I never!
[->]What am I, a housewife who looks
after you?

157: I see...
You want help...
Well, I never!
If you just asked...
We'd heal you!

a little money.
[->]So tell me, boy, what are you going
to do with it?
[->][END]
159: Oh my!
What a boor!
That won't do!
Get a job.
And keep it!

160: [71 1]What a pitiful boy you are, with that
hangdog look on your face.
[->]Here, I'll give you this. But just
this once, all right?
[->][END]
161: Oh well...
Here you go!
Just this once!
It's special!
Remember that!
[END]
162: [71 1]Boy, are you so simple that you repeat
the same thing over and over?
[->][END]
163: Is that it?
You daft, boy?
The same stuff...
Over and over!
Simpleminded, eh?
[END]
164: [71 1]I found you, [Flynn]! Honestly,
child, you're such a handful.
[->]Did you work on being a gentleman
since the last time? Well, show me...
[->][END]
165: [71 1]...Wait right there, boy. Aren't you
being a bit of a brute, killing me
cold like this?
[->]Yes, I s'pose I am begging for my
life... What'll it take for you to
spare me?
[->][END]
166: ...Hold on.
You're killing us?
That's no good.
What should we do?
We're begging you!
[END]
167: [71 1]If that's what it takes to buy my life,
then it's a cheap price to pay.
[->][END]
168: That's good.
If that's the cost...
All right, then.
That's not so much.
A small price!
[END]
169: [71 1]So you're dead set on killing me...
All right, I understand.
[->]I'll show you how a real demon dies!
[->][END]
170: We understand!
This is it, then!
