1: [71 1]You−−a human−−wish to make an ally
of me?
[->]Hahaha! Your jokes will not distract
me. Let us return to battle.
[->][END]
2: A contract?
With a human!?
Ha!
What nerve!
Begone!
[END]
3: [71 1]Is it a human custom to attack
someone before extending a greeting?
[->]How barbaric...
[->][END]
4: How rude!
You would attack us?
You humans...
Barbaric!
Disgusting.
[END]
5: [71 1]...What manner of jest is this?
[->]I would never pass up the opportunity
to kill a human.
[->][END]
6: [71 1]Now, then... I cannot become your
ally for free, of course.
[->][END]
7: A contract?
We have our price.
It's very fair...
What do you say?
We will be paid.
[END]
8: [71 1]Very well. From this point on, I am
yours to command.
[->][END]
9: Very well.
Our strength is yours.
We will serve.
Our contract...
Please take it.
[END]
10: [71 1]First, you must offer me a gift.
It is but a common courtesy.
[->][END]
11: There must be gifts.
It is only courtesy.
Let us have them.
Gifts, yes.
Give them to us.
[END]
12: [71 1]Hmm... It would seem that you cannot
take any more demons with you.
[->]Que sera, sera.
...Farewell.
[->][END]
13: [71 1]I am [Color:0x5][Demon race 1] [Demon name 1].[Color:0x0]
It is a pleasure to meet you.
[->][END]
14: [71 1]Ah... It seems that my level is
superior to yours.
[->]My apologies, but I cannot become
your ally.
[->][END]
15: [71 1]Hm? I see that one of my fellows is
accompanying you.
[->]See to it he is treated properly.
[->][END]
16: [71 1]I have an idea! Allow me to invite
other demons to join us.
[->][END]
17: [71 1]Oh... But it seems that you only have
enough room for me.
[->]I suppose I won't extend an invitation
to anyone else, then.
[->][END]
18: [71 1]I shall join you as well. I am
feeling generous at the moment.
[->][END]
19: [71 1]...Don't let it get to you.
You simply lack charisma.
[->][END]
20: [71 1]Next, I shall join you...
[->][END]
21: [71 1]Hm... It would be a shame to waste
this opportunity. I shall introduce
you as an acquaintance of mine.
[->]I have a wide network of associates
to select from.
[->][END]
22: [71 1][Demon name 2] summoned me at very
short notice. I have a very demanding
boss...
[->]...And now I must become this human's
ally? Oh, very well.
[->][END]
23: Hm!
You already have one.
Excellent taste.
Ho−ho...
Use him wisely.
[END]
24: You can trust us.
Do not hesitate.
We have power.
Feel free to use it.
Farewell.
[END]
25: [71 1]You would ask a demon for a truce?
You have such an innocent mind.
[->]...But, no matter. My mood depends
on what gifts you have to offer.
[->][END]
26: A truce?
How droll.
We'll consider it!
Of course...
You have gifts, yes?
[END]
27: [71 1]You are excused. You should be
thanking me for my clemency.
[->][END]
28: You are excused.
Begone.
Remember this.
We are merciful.
Be grateful.
[END]
29: [71 1]You would interrupt my slumber...?
Troublesome human...
[->]Leave me be...
[->][END]
30: Zzzzzz...
Zzzzzz...
Zzzzzz...
Zzzzzz...
*yawn*
[END]
31: You would wake us?
How rude...
Wastrel...
Begone!
Let us sleep...
[END]
32: [71 1]A moment, if you will.
I shall heal you.
[->]If I did not do this, a weak creature
such as you would not last very long.
[->][END]
33: One moment...
We shall heal you.
It is a mercy.
You would die soon.
Fragile human.
[END]
34: [71 1]...Sorry, but I do not have the time
to deal with humans.
[->]That is, unless you have a gift for
me.
[->][END]
35: You have a gift?
Very wise, human.
Let us have it.
Come, come.
Share.
[END]
36: [71 1]Very well... Hear my refined words,
and let us speak of enjoyable things.
[->][END]
37: Hmhmhm...!
Splendid!
Humans!
Praising me!
This ecstasy!
[END]
38: [71 1]Ah... To waste one's precious life
simply prattling away... Is this not
an extravagant pastime?
[->]Please, allow me to join you in an
idle conversation.
[->][END]
39: A gift!?
For us!?
Ahh...!
This feeling...!
What joy!
[END]
40: [71 1]Today, I am truly a master of the
art of conversation. I could talk
all night!
[->][END]
41: Hahaha!
Excellent!
Inferior human!
More!
Give me more!
[END]
42: [71 1]You would throw yourself upon the
mercy of a demon? Hmhmhm...
You are a clever man.
[->]But, first, I will have my pay.
[->][END]
43: ...Really?
You want our mercy?
Amusing.
Very well...
But we will be paid.
[END]
44: [71 1]Now, here is a demon's grandest form
of mercy. Let it seep into your body.
[->][END]
45: Allow us...
This is our mercy.
Feel its power.
Feel it...
Let it into you.
[END]
46: [71 1]Zzzzz... I would rather you not
interrupt my slumber.
[->]If you wish for mercy...
Then, here, you have it.
[->][END]
47: Zzzzzz...
Zzzzzz...
Zzzzzz...
Zzzzzz...
*yawn*
[END]
48: You would awaken us?
...To worship us?
You have our mercy.
Now, leave us.
We wish to sleep...
[END]
49: [71 1]Hmhmhm... What a splendid feeling.
Here, allow me to do it again.
[->][END]
50: Ah...
That was splendid.
It felt very fine.
Let us try again.
Hrmm...
[END]
51: [71 1]You would ask me, a demon, to invest
in a human's future?
[->]Without a five−hundred−year
business plan, I can see nothing
more foolish than this idea.
[->][END]
52: Those hands!
Those eyes!
How evil!
What is this...!?
Human, you−−!
[END]
53: [71 1]Ugh−−! Can a human blinded by greed
truly be this dangerous...!?
[->][END]
54: How terrifying!
Human...!
I see you truly now!
What horror...
Urrrgh!
[END]
55: [71 1]Did you think that wealth equates
with power? Then I shall teach you...
[->]Feel what real power is!
[->][END]
56: Insolence!
Learn your place!
I will kill you!
We will feast on you!
Now face us!
[END]
57: [71 1]Ahhhh! Stop that immediately!
[->][END]
58: Ahhhh!
Stop that!
No!
Argh!
I apologize!
[END]
59: [71 1]P−Please...! Enough of this madness...
[->][END]
60: We apologize...!
Forgive us...!
So...!
Please!
Enough...!
[END]
61: [71 1]Ugh... If this is truly happening,
then you can have my money.
[->]I would rather be destitute than
face the prospect of being forever
pestered by a human!
[->][END]
62: Forgive me...!
Take my money!
How is that?
It is enough, no?
Enough...!
[END]
63: [71 1]I said, ”Enough!” That is it, you
filthy nincompoop!
[->][END]
64: Stop!
Enough, damn you!
Are you deaf!?
Leave off!
Let us be!
[END]
65: [71 1]You would ask me for funds, after
rendering me helpless...!?
[->]I would never invest in a scheme
headed by someone like you!
[->][END]
66: I cannot move...!
How evil...!
Such treachery!
Vile human!
You will suffer!
[END]
67: [71 1]You have an interest in a demon's
belongings? Well, then, let us begin
our bargaining.
[->][END]
68: It is not ”selling.”
How boorish.
Think of this...
...as ”mutual gifting.”
Let us negotiate.
[END]
69: [71 1]Handle it with care, o greedy human.
[->][END]
70: We have a deal.
Now, then...
Take care.
You are greedy...
We are done here.
[END]
71: [71 1]You show an interest in the
belongings of demons...? Hmhmhm!
You have excellent taste!
[->]Now, take as much as you want,
o greedy human!
[->][END]
72: You show interest?
What do we have here?
Oh, very good!
Take it all, human!
You have taste!
[END]
73: [71 1]I will give you this, as well.
It seems a perfect fit for someone
as greedy as yourself.
[->][END]
74: Have this, too.
Greedy human...
This befits you.
Hmhmhm.
Yes, take it.
[END]
75: [71 1]Let us try something different for a
change. We will let money be the
deciding factor.
[->]Give me... hm... [Color:0x1][Amount 1] Macca.[Color:0x0]
What say you, human?
[->][END]
76: This is dull.

Take your time.
What is it?

We knew you'd know.
Very well...
Now then...
We shall take it.

You failed our test.
Things seem poor.
Ah, well.
How disappointing.

107: [71 1]I find myself in the mood to strike
you on the head. It being empty, it
should make a pleasant sound.

108: Hmm...
Is your head hollow?
Let us strike it.
We want to hear.
May we?

109: ”Go ahead and try.”
”My head is full.”

Just one strike.
We shall hold back.

Worry not...

How loud is it?
Listen close!

It was a joke!

Were you serious?
Hahaha!

125: Hmmm...
That is your choice?
I see...
Now then...
What should we do?

I see...
Such insolence!

again.

I am fed up.

You mock me...

What to do now...
A destitute...

You need a Life Stone.
Do not even try.

frugality does serve a purpose
every so often.

137: Oh?
Are we too demanding?
Very well.
We shall be stingy.
Hmhm.

A mere human...
Ordering us around?
I see...
You mock us...

even men.

141: Bah...?
You still refuse us?
It's surprising...
Still...
We are impressed.

142: [71 1]No... You are too obedient for my
tastes.
[->]Our negotiations end here.
[->][END]
143: You are hard to trust.
You agree too easily!
Hm...
I think not.
This talk is over.
[END]
144: [71 1]Oh? You have nothing at all to give
me? Hmhmhm... You must lead a
wretched existence.
[->]You have my sympathy. Please, say
no more on the subject.

145: You have nothing?
How wretched!
Then...
I sympathize with you.
I am satisfied.

Sorry...
There are matters...

You and us?
You need our help?
We will be happy.
But of course...

I have no reason to fight you, either.

I have no reason...

I wish you luck.
Now go.

154: [71 1]...Did you think I would waste my
time chatting with humans?
[->]...Of course, I don't see our
conversation as a waste of time.
You are special.

155: A gift...?
For us?
Splendid!
You fascinate me.
This is nice.

What is it you want?
By all means, take it.
Here you go.
Leave us in peace.

friend to another. Please, I need
no repayment. Hmhmhm...

You are a friend.
Do not hesistate.
No need for payment.
Please, take it.

162: [71 1]Again? It seems you will speak of
nothing else!

163: Again...?
Fool.
A broken record...

Stop saying that!

understand how important I am?

165: [71 1]Sh−Sheathe your blade! We can settle
this like civilized beings!

Please, lower your weapon!

Let us talk!
Lower your weapon...
We are at your mercy.
Please!

167: [71 1]Ha... hahaha! If that is the cost of
my life, so be it.

168: Hmhmhm...
Excellent...
A cheap price...
We shall meet it.
Another day...

Perhaps you would be willing to carry

Is this coincidence?
[->]I have a business proposition for you.
Perhaps you would be willing to carry
out a task for me?

173: [71 1]A wise decision... Now, let us discuss
the details further.
[->]This request comes from a certain
someone that I know...
