0: (Demon) [7a 64941][13 1, 413106]This is the last remaining fortress
of the Amatsu... If you have no
business here, then leave at once.
[->]We must endure here until the return
of our leader, Amaterasu.
[END]
1: (Demon) [7a 64941][13 1, 413100]Oh, I recognize you.
You are [Flynn], are you not?
[->]You were the one who appeared within
my divination. The human that is to
be the hope of our race.
[->]Please, I implore you to help us.
[->]Ah, but where are my manners?
I am Futotama, one of the ruling
class of the Amatsu.
[->](Futotama) [7a 64941][13 1, 413101]We, the Amatsu, are continually being
trodden upon by the demons who wish
to take over Tokyo for themselves.
[->]Our leader Amaterasu has been sealed
away, and the power of the Amatsu is
nothing more than a candle's flicker.
[->]I want to somehow free Amaterasu,
and preserve the Amatsu race from
extinction.
[->]In order to free Amaterasu, I require
three different holy vessels...
[->][Color:0x5]The Yata Mirror, the Yasakani
Magatama, and the Ameno Murakumo Sword.[Color:0x0]
I require these sacred treasures.
[END]
2: (Futotama) [7a 64941][13 1, 413100]Hm? You already have the three holy
vessels with you? Well, that makes
things much easier.
[END]
3: (Futotama) [7a 64941][13 1, 413101]Two of the vessels can be found in a
shrine located [Color:0x5]north[Color:0x0] of here. They are
the Yoroi Shrine and the Kiou Shrine.
[->]The last one will be found on the
[Color:0x5]east side[Color:0x0] of Tokyo, in a shrine known
as the Kabuto Shrine.
[->]Once you have collected all three of
the holy vessels, please bring them
to me.
[->]All the shrines have been consumed by
the Domains of foreign demons that
guard the holy vessels.
[->]Please, be careful.
[END]
4: (Futotama) [7a 64941][13 1, 413005]Hm? You have already collected the
three holy vessels?
[->]All of them? Already!?
[->][13 1, 413102]Ah, finally. The three holy vessels
have been collected. With these, I
will be able to free Amaterasu!
[->]Let us go, [Flynn], to the land
where Amaterasu is sealed...
[->]That is... The [Color:0x5]Tokyo Castle Ruins[Color:0x0]
to the north of Kasumigaseki.
[->]There, I want you to deliver...
No, to make an offering.
[->]I repeat, [Flynn], go to the
[Color:0x5]Tokyo Castle Ruins.[Color:0x0]
[END]
5: (Futotama) [7a 64941][13 1, 413102]Ah! You have collected all three of
the holy vessels.

[END]
6: (Futotama) [7a 64941][13 1, 413103][Flynn], go to the [Color:0x5]Tokyo Castle
Ruins[Color:0x0] north of Kasumigaseki.
[->]That is where Amaterasu has been
sealed.
[END]
7: 〉 There is a strong seal on this
place, but you sense a strange power
as well...

8: 〉 The three holy vessels begin to
glow, and the seal weakens...

9: Yes
No
[END]
10: (Futotama) [7a 64941][13 1, 413103]Now then, [Flynn].
[->]Give the three holy vessels as an
offering.

wish has been fulfilled...
[END]
12: 〉 Amaterasu's seal has been broken...
[END]
13: (Amaterasu) [7a 65356][13 1, 418003]Ah... I have once again returned to
this world.
[->]And it is all thanks to you,
[Flynn]. You have my gratitude.
[->]I apologize for the trouble that I
have caused Futotama.
[END]
14: (Futotama) [7a 0][13 1, 413104]Think nothing of it. All I needed was
to know that you are safe and sound,
Amaterasu.
[->]I suggest you leave this land at
once, so that you may recover your
strength.
[->]Once you have recovered, let us
return to this barren land and become
the leading force in redeveloping it.
[->]The other Japanese gods shall follow
your lead.
[END]
15: (Amaterasu) [7a 65356][13 1, 418002]Very well.
[->]I will take my leave now.
[->]But, before I go, I shall bestow a
boon upon you, [Flynn].
[->]I shall grant you a portion of the
Amatsu Futotama's power.
[->]That is, the power of flight.
[->]Even a human like yourself can
attain flight.
[END]
16: 〉 [Flynn] has received
Torifune's Shawl.
[END]
17: (Amaterasu) [7a 65356]This is the best I can offer as of
this moment...
[->]Now, go, for the world that you
dream of...

18: 〉 Amaterasu leaves...
[END]
19: 〉 The three holy vessels are glowing
brighter than ever, as if they are
reacting to one another...

Futotama to fly across Tokyo.
[->]〉 Press [button 0] at designated
spots in Tokyo to use Futotama's
power to fly or land.
[->]〉 This will allow you to travel
much more easily than before, so
use it often.

21: (Demon) [7a 64941][13 1, 413106]This is the last remaining fortress
of the Amatsu... If you have no
business here, then leave at once.
[->]Or, perhaps... Did you come here in
regards to the job that I requested?
[END]
22: ”Yes, I did.”
”No.”
[END]
23: (Demon) [7a 64941][13 1, 413009]Then you have no reason to remain
in this place. Leave at once, child
of man.
