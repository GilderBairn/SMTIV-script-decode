performing Demon Fusions over and
over...
[->]〉 All the Hunters have blank faces,

manipulated by something else...
[->]〉 Do you want to call out to them?

No

5: (Cernunnos) [7a 0][13 1, 478007]Well, well, well. I thought somebody
was trying to get in my way.
You again, huh?
[->]It's already too late. Things are
just about finished.
[->]Baphomet, it's time to fuse.
[->]With this fusion, you can regain the
godhood that you once held.

You recognize the sounds of a Demon
Fusion...

8: (Cernunnos) [7a 0][13 1, 478001]There it is! The resurrection of the
Roman Vile Pales.
[->]That's another ancient power stolen
from us by God, and now regained!
[->]We are resurrecting the ancient gods'
powers, to amass a force strong enough
to defeat God Himself.
[->]You humans can all shut up and be
our sacrifices, just like the good
old days!

Hunters...
[END]
12: (Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403043]I see... So a demon did all this...?
[->]Hm. My phone shows that someone's
been using it for a whole lot of
fusions lately... Guess you're right.
[->]Looks like you saved our lives.
Thanks, man.
