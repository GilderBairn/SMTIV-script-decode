0: 〉 There is a demon standing at the
back of the room...

[Flynn]...

1: (Mokoi) [7a 65062][13 1, 495805]Pyro Jack's looking... for me?
[->]I see... Guess they're worrying
about me.
[->]It's true. I used to help out weaker
demons that were being attacked by
other demons and humans.
[->]I got them to a safe place called
Naraku. Well, safer, anyway.
[->]But, you know what? If the end, a
Mokoi's still just a Mokoi. I was
doing pretty good in the beginning...
[->]But I didn't stand a chance against
the strong demons in Shibuya. It
took everything I had to survive.
[->]I can't go back now. There's no way.
[->]I never meant to, but I guess I've
become something of a hero to them.
[->]If I went back now, I wouldn't be a
hero anymore.
[END]
2: ”You're just a Mokoi.”
”Your friends miss you.”
”You'll always be their hero.”
[END]
3: (Mokoi) [7a 65062][13 1, 495805]I know you're just repeating what
I said, but it really bothers me
to hear a human like you say that.
[->]Hey, I might not look like it, but
where I'm from I was the baddest evil
spirit around. Don't rile me up!
[->]......
[->][13 1, 495800]Heh. I see what you're trying to
do. Thanks, human.
[->]I guess it's about time I left this
place, huh?
[END]
4: (Mokoi) [7a 65062][13 1, 495805]Miss me? You think they still miss
someone like me? I gave up on them!
[->]......
[->][13 1, 495800]I see... I guess it's more important
to be alive as a friend than to be
remembered as a hero...
[END]
5: (Mokoi) [7a 65062][13 1, 495805]You say that...
[->]...but I didn't really do much.
I'm not anybody great.
[->]......
[->][13 1, 495800]Oh, man. What was I getting all hung
up over?
[->]Thanks, human. I think I see what's
really important now.
[END]
6: (Mokoi) [7a 65062]Okay, I get it.
Night Mokoi's going home!
[END]
7: 〉 The Mokoi leaves...

900: 〉 There is nobody here...
