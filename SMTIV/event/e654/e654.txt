0: (Female Hunter) [7a 70][13 1, 403142]The city of Ginza's a nice place to
live, if you've got power. But if you
don't, you're gonna have a bad time.
[->]In order to even be able to walk
around the city, you have to prove
yourself to the Ring of Gaea...
[->]Even if you want to go around to
explore the ruins, there are a lot
of places that people can't go.
[->]If they don't let you pass, you
might be better off getting some fame
in another city and coming back.
[END]
1: (Female Hunter) [7a 70][13 1, 403142]Have you tried to visit the surface
of Ginza? I hear there's a lot of
high−quality stuff you can find.
[->]But, the way is guarded by the Ring
of Gaea, and they only let celebrities
pass through.
[->]So, the only people allowed to search
for treasure there are the rich, and
the rich keep getting richer...
[->]It's terrible how they try to maintain
their position of wealth... And it's
hypocritical to their ”meritocracy.”
[->]I came to take a look at that famous
store, the Luis Witon... But they
won't let me. What a disappointment.
[END]
2: 〉 The Hunter leaves...
[END]
3: Show her the camera
Shrug
[END]
4: (Female Hunter) [7a 70][13 1, 403141]Huh? Would you be willing to take a
picture of the Luis Witon store
for me?
[->]Are you sure? It's very tough to get
into Ginza's shopping district.
[->]...Well, if you're offering, thanks!
I would like to see this Luis Witon
I've been hearing about.
[->]I'll be looking forward to it.
[END]
5: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 1, 502043]I'll register that as a new quest
on the list.
[END]
6: (Female Hunter) [7a 70][13 1, 403131]I hear that ”Luis Witon” used to
be worshipped like some sort of god
back in the old days.
[->]Isn't that interesting? It's just a
name on a bag, but people take so
much interest in it.
[->]Please bring me a picture of
Luis Witon once you get it.
[END]
7: (Female Hunter) [7a 70][13 1, 403123]...I guess a poor rookie Hunter like
me isn't meant to be in a city like
Ginza...
[END]
8: 〉 This appears to be the store that
the Hunter wanted to see.
[->]〉 Would you like to take a picture?
[END]
9: Take a picture
Not right now
[END]
10: 〉 You now have a picture of the
Luis Witon store in Ginza.
[END]
11: 〉 You leave the area.
[END]
12: (Female Hunter) [7a 70][13 1, 403142]Oh... Did you bring me a picture?
[END]
13: 〉 You give the woman the picture.
[END]
14: (Female Hunter) [7a 70][13 1, 403141]Yep, that's what I wanted to see.
[->]The fact that you were even allowed
over there must mean that you have
a platinum card.
[->]That's very impressive. Hahaha...
[->]Maybe you'll be able to find that
black card I left behind.
[END]
15: (Female Hunter) [7a 70][13 1, 403133]I wish you the best of luck.
So long!
[END]
16: (Female Hunter) [7a 70][13 1, 403131]Oh, it would seem you already have a
black card... You really are amazing.
[->]I suppose Ginza is a place meant for
people with power, like you.
[->][13 1, 403133]I'll treasure this picture.
So long!
[END]
100: (Female Hunter) [7a 70][13 1, 403142]You don't have the picture?
Well, I'll keep waiting here for you
to get it...
[END]
900: 〉 There is no one here...
