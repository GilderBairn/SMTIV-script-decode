0: (Red Knight) [7a 135][13 0, 690000]I thought you might turn up,
[Flynn].
[->][13 0, 690001]I have heard rumors about you. You were
the famous Demon Hunter... or, rather,
Samurai.
[->][13 0, 690002]Who could have known that you would
be a Samurai?
[->][13 0, 690003]Although you may not be aware of it,
you have drawn your sword on your
king...
[END]
1: 〉 The Red Knight lifts the visor of
his helmet...
[->]〉 The knight's face seems familiar
to you...
[END]
2: (Red Knight) [7a 135][13 0, 690004]Gaze upon this face, for I am none
other than King Ahazuya of Mikado.
[->][13 0, 690005]I have been driven from my former
station, hunted by angels, and forced
to hide among the Unclean Ones.
[->][13 0, 690006]It is an embarrassment. To have my
revenge, I have abandoned my status to
attain the power to defeat the angels.
[->][13 0, 690007][Flynn]... if you truly are a
Samurai, then you will lend me your
strength.
[->][13 0, 690008]This is an order from your king.
[END]
3: Agree to cooperate with him
Refuse
[END]
4: (Red Knight) [7a 135][13 0, 690009]You are a true Samurai of your liege.
[->][13 0, 690010]And now... I order you to become a
sacrifice to the Overlord Baal!
[END]
5: (Red Knight) [7a 135][13 0, 690011]...So much for faithfulness to one's
rightful king.
[->][13 0, 690012]Very well then, I shall prepare the
sacrifice to the Overlord Baal myself,
with your head!
[END]
6: 〉 The Red Knight's armor falls apart
and clatters to the floor...
[->]〉 The armor is completely empty,
except for the helmet.
[->]〉 The head of King Ahazuya of Mikado
speaks, with a demon's voice...
[END]
7: (Decapitated Head) [7a 65369][13 0, 690013]Your sword now runs with the blood of
your once and former king. This is the
second time he has been killed...
[->][13 0, 690014]This man did not pray to God in his
final moments. No... He prayed to me,
Baal, for help instead.
[->][13 0, 690015](Voice of Baal) [7a 65369]Betrayed by the God that he once
worshipped, he sought something new
to cling to.
[->][13 0, 690016]Even I felt sympathy for this king,
who had nothing left to believe in but
a mere idol that he found in books.
[->][13 0, 690017]And, feeling his desire for revenge,
I answered his call to defeat God. I
possessed his corpse to use as a body.
[->][13 0, 690018]But, even in death, he could not be
free... So I shall take action, all
for this pitiful and lonely ruler.
[END]
8: 〉 Something changes in the air around
you...
[END]
9: (Voice of Baal) [7a 65369][13 0, 690019]Now then, [Flynn].
[->][13 0, 690020]Your existence is an extreme danger,
and one that cannot be allowed to
continue.
[->][13 0, 690021]I am reluctant to do so, but in order
to defeat you, I must take on my true
form...
[->][13 0, 690022]You shall feel the might of an
unmatched power that is worshipped
through fear...
[END]
10: 〉 The demon transforms into a great
swarm of flies, which scatter in
every direction...
[END]
11: 〉 The head of King Ahazuya rests at
your feet...
[END]
12: Give it a proper burial
Leave it
[END]
13: 〉 As you reach down to pick up the
king's head...
[->]〉 You see the king's sword glowing
in the pile of fallen armor.
[END]
14: 〉 You pick up the king's sword from
the ground as you leave...
[->]〉 You have obtained the Sword of
Aquila.
[END]
15: (Demon) [7a 65112][13 1, 412100]What's this? A human? My master is
not here at the moment.
[->]You're quite lucky, you know. You humans
won't survive for very long, once my
master is resurrected.
[->]That's simply how it is.
Now run along, please.
[END]
16: 〉 The demon flaps its wing dismissively
and darkness suddenly falls upon you...
[END]
17: 〉 When you take the sword, the glow
begins to fade...
[->]〉 You have obtained the Sword of
Aquila.
[END]
18: 〉 You see a knight in red armor
standing here...
[END]
20: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 0, 76036]I'm detecting a strong demon ahead.
Do you want to go on?
[END]
21: Yes
No
[END]
900: 〉 There is no one here...
