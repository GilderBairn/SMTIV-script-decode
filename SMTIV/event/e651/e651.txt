0: (Furtive man) [7a 31][13 1, 403002]Let me explain the details of this
request to you.
[->]I'm not going to name any names.
I'm sure you understand.
[->]A lot of us are worried about the
future right now. We were thinking
about getting some magic weapons.
[->]As you probably already know, the
gap between the Luxurors and
Casualries has been closed.
[->]It's almost as if this world is
slowly progressing towards a utopia
for us.
[->]...But is this truly going to become
a utopia? Is this what equality truly
means?
[->]I feel that all that has happened
is that we have brought everyone down
to the level of the former Casualries.
[->]I believe that we must prepare for
the day we have the power to pierce
through to the sun shining above us!
[->]I want you to lend us your strength.
Would you help us in our search for
weaponry?
[END]
1: ”Yes.”
”No.”
[END]
2: (Furtive man) [7a 31][13 1, 403033]So you'll do it for us!?
[->]We're specifically trying to find
ancient weapons known as ”guns.”
[->]I've only read about them in books,
but apparently these weapons were
completely ground−breaking.
[->]I'd prefer to get some of the larger
ones. If you can, try to find us some
guns known as [Color:0x5]bazookas.[Color:0x0]
[->]Why don't you try searching for them
in a military facility? I mean, they
are powerful weapons.
[->]I'm counting on you.
[END]
3: (Furtive man) [7a 31][13 1, 403012]Why don't you understand? At the
rate things are going, our future
holds nothing but disaster...!
[->]...I don't intend to force you into
this. We will wait for you to change
your mind on your own.
[END]
4: (Furtive man) [7a 31][13 1, 403002]It looks like you brought me the
weapons.
[->]Did you find the bazookas?
[->]So you really did it...
[END]
5: (Furtive man) [7a 31][13 1, 403043]The goods have been delivered.
...Don't look so worried.
[->]We don't want to use these to trigger
a war.
[->]These are only to be used to protect
people's lives. You have my word.
[->][13 1, 403033]...It's unlikely that our paths will
ever cross again, but you have my
thanks.
[END]
6: 〉 The man leaves...
[END]
7: (Furtive man) [7a 31][13 1, 403042]What's wrong? You haven't found the
weapons yet?
[->]Please, tell me once you've found
the weapons I'm looking for.
[->]Why don't you try searching for them
in a military facility? I mean, they
are powerful weapons.
[END]
8: (Furtive man) [7a 31]Did you bring me the weapons?
[END]
9: (Furtive man) [7a 31]I'll keep asking as many times as I
need to. Will you help us search for
weapons?
[END]
100: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 1, 502043]I'll register that as a new quest
on the list.
[END]
900: 〉 There is nobody here...
[END]
