0: (Old woman) [7a 65][13 1, 403903]I'm far too old to go outside now...
[->]When I escaped, all my pictures were
burned. I lost everything I had.
[->]I wonder if I'll ever be able to see
the outside world again...
[END]
1: Show her your camera
Leave
[END]
2: (Old woman) [7a 65][13 1, 403902]Is that... a camera?
[->]Well, that's quite the antique you've
got there. You don't see young folk
with a sense of style these days.
[->]Oh, I know... Hey, can I ask you for
a favor?
[->]I used to own a bar in the back of
the Golden Gai.
[->]Could you use your camera there to
take a picture of it for me?
Just one picture...
[END]
3: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 1, 502043]I'll register the new quest onto the
list.
[END]
4: (Old woman) [7a 65][13 1, 403923]I've grown old now. If I'm going to
die, I want to die happy.
[->]I want to have a way to remember the
happiest times of my life. Please,
let me see that place one more time.
[END]
5: (Old woman) [7a 65][13 1, 403922]I see... I guess I'll just slowly rot
away here. All of Tokyo has been
sealed away and made into a dungeon...
[END]
6: 〉 You enter the bar...
[END]
7: Take a picture
Not now
[END]
8: 〉 You now have a picture of the bar.
[END]
9: 〉 You leave...
[END]
10: (Old woman) [7a 65][13 1, 403902]You brought me the picture?
[END]
11: 〉 You give her the picture you took
earlier.
[END]
12: (Old woman) [7a 65][13 1, 403931]...It's like I thought. There's
nothing left. Just an empty room.
[->]But, you know what... I can still
see it. The shelves, lined with
cheap booze...
[->]The table over there always wobbled.
And over there we had the register,
where she would ring up customers...
[->][13 1, 403923]......
[->]My daughter and I used to run the
bar together.
[->]That was 25 years ago. When the
demons appeared suddenly, they killed
her... and ate her.
[->]Running that bar with my daughter
was the happiest time in my life.
[->][13 1, 403933]Now I can die, having remembered
those happy times one last time.
Thank you.
[END]
13: (Old woman) [7a 65][13 1, 403933]Now I can die, having remembered
those happy times one last time.
Thank you.
[END]
900: 〉 There is no one here...
