but you feel as if you are being
watched...

1: (Sharp−Eyed man) [7a 38]......
[END]
2: 〉 The man stares down at you...
[->]〉 Do you want to ask him about the
quest?
[END]
3: Yes
No

4: 〉 [Flynn] asks about the quest that
he had accepted earlier.
[END]
5: 〉 [Flynn] gives what he believes to
be the password...

is incorrect.

6: 〉 [Flynn] leaves the area...
[END]
7: (Sharp−Eyed man) [7a 38][13 1, 403241]I see that you've accepted my
request, Samurai.
[->]......!
[->]Wait a moment... Aren't you
[Flynn]? You were formerly a
Casualry, isn't that right?
[->][13 1, 403242]I see...
[->]My name is Rodolfo, a stonemason
from O'Gickbough.
[->](Rodolfo) [7a 38]You come from the Casualry class...
I suppose I can trust you.
[->]...Of course, it's not as if I'm
asking for something strange.
[->]I mean, it is the sort of thing that
I need to request assistance from a
Samurai for...
[->]But, you see, the things I want to
ask for are, well...
[->]Let's just say that there's a good
chance the Monastery won't approve
of it.
[->]That's why I want to directly make
my request to a Samurai I can trust.
[->]We've read the books. We know a
little about the world below us.
[->]There are Casualries that need those
relics that come from the world below.
[->]I want you to help these people out.
[->]I'll leave it to you, [Flynn],
as to whether or not you will accept
the request.
[->]If you do feel like fulfilling my
requests, just come talk to me here.
[->]That's all I have to say for now.
[->]There aren't too many Samurai that
I can trust, so I'm counting on you.
[END]
8: (Rodolfo) [7a 38][13 1, 403202]Ah, [Flynn].
Thanks for coming.
[END]
9: ”How can I help you?”
”Just seeing if you're still here.”
[END]
10: (Rodolfo) [7a 38][13 1, 403203]I... I see. Well, do come by again
if you have time.
[END]
11: (Rodolfo) [7a 38][13 1, 403242]You're going to take on one of my
requests? Thank you.
[->]I have just the task in mind for
you, [Flynn].
[END]
12: (Rodolfo) [7a 38][13 1, 403242]You're going to take on one of my
requests? Thank you.
[->]I have two requests that I would
like to give to you at the moment.
[->]Here is the first one...
[->][END]
13: (Rodolfo) [7a 38][13 1, 403242]You're going to take on one of my
requests? Thank you.
[->]I have three requests that I would
like to give to you at the moment.
[->]Here is the first one...
[->][END]
14: (Rodolfo) [7a 38]A certain group of young men has
requested your assistance. I cannot
talk about the details.
[->]They will tell you more about this
request in person.
[END]
15: (Rodolfo) [7a 38]This request comes from two brothers
seeking to save their ill sister.
[->]I want you to help them, but...
[END]
16: (Rodolfo) [7a 38]There's a certain man who needs an
escort.
[->]This man was once a member of the
Luxuror caste...
[->]I'm not sure what he's done, but
someone's after his life.
[->]I don't fully agree with this
request, but I cannot in good
conscience ignore it.
[->]What I would ask of you, Samurai,
is for you to take him to the world
below.
[->]There is nowhere left in the Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado where this man can
live in peace.
[->]I have heard from other Samurai
that a man named Fujiwara can be
trusted with such matters.
[->]Could you escort this man to
Fujiwara?
[->]A note, if you do plan to carry out
this request...
[->]Try going to the back of the forest
after accepting it.
[->]I'm sure he's determined that
nobody finds him.
[->]I leave him in your care.
[END]
17: (Rodolfo) [7a 38][13 1, 403242]This is the other request I wanted
to ask you about.
[END]
18: (Rodolfo) [7a 38]Do you want to hear the details
from the client?
[END]
19: ”Yes.”
”No.”
[END]
20: (Rodolfo) [7a 38][13 1, 403242]Thanks. Let's go get the client.
[END]
21: (Rodolfo) [7a 38][13 1, 403243]...I see. Well, if you ever change
your mind, I'll be waiting.
[END]
22: (Rodolfo) [7a 38][13 1, 403203]I appreciate your efforts, but you
have already helped everyone who
has requested your assistance.
[->]All the requests you have carried
out are things that we Casualries
could never do on our own.
[->]I am most grateful for your help.
If anything new comes up, I will
be sure to let you know.
[END]
23: (Rodolfo) [7a 38][13 1, 403242]It looks like everyone's problems
have been solved thanks to you,
[Flynn].
[->]Thank you for all the help you have
given us. You have my gratitude.
[END]
24: (Rodolfo) [7a 38][13 1, 403241]Ah, so you've brought the goods
that were asked for.
[->]Do you want to give them to the
client right now?
[END]
25: (Rodolfo) [7a 38][13 1, 403241]...Hm? Looks like you've got the
medicine in question.
[->]Do you want to give it to the
brothers right now?
[END]
26: (Rodolfo) [7a 38][13 1, 403242]Let me go get the clients, then.
[END]
27: 〉 What will you say to him?
[END]
28: (Rodolfo) [7a 38][13 1, 403241]...Hm? Looks like you've got the
medicine in question.
[->]Do you want to give it to the
brothers right now?
[END]
100: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 1, 502043]I'll register the new quest in
the list.
[END]
900: 〉 There is no one here...
