0: (Isis) [7a 65161][13 1, 418004]Thank you for coming, [Flynn].
It pleases me to meet you again.
[->]I had faith that you would once again
come to my aid in my hour of need.
[->]My current situation is related to
your retrieving the coffin of my
husband, Osiris.
[->]Thanks to you, I was able to make
the necessary preparations for his
resurrection.
[->][13 1, 418006]However, Seth caught wind of my goal,
and attacked us once again.
[->]This time, he has dismembered the
body of my husband, and scattered the
parts in different areas of Tokyo...
[->]As you can probably guess, I ask of
you to collect the pieces of Osiris'
body and bring them back to me.
[->]I am sorry that I must always ask
you to undertake these troublesome
tasks...
[->]Please, help my bring back my
husband.
[END]
1: (Isis) [7a 65161][13 1, 418003]Once you have collected all of the
body parts, please bring them back
to me.
[->]The continual sacrilege to Osiris'
body is causing his anger to build.
[->]At this rate, there may be some
negative effects in the areas where
the parts of his body are hidden.
[->]I am counting on you.
[END]
2: (Isis) [7a 65161][13 1, 418004]Could it be... Have you found all of
my husband's body?
[END]
3: 〉 You try to give Osiris' body to
Isis...
[END]
4: (Demon's voice) [7a 65411][13 1, 494205]I will not allow the resurrection of
Osiris...
[END]
5: (Isis) [7a 65161][13 1, 418007]As I expected, Seth was waiting for
us to collect all the parts...
[->]But you defeated Seth, [Flynn].
[->]I am finally able to conduct the
ritual necessary to resurrect Osiris.
[->]Now, [Flynn].
Place Osiris' body here.
[END]
6: (Isis) [7a 65161][13 1, 418003]What is the matter? You're being
quite the tease, you know.
[->]I suppose I am getting a little too
worked up from the joy of being able
to see my husband again.
[->]Very well. I shall wait a little
longer.
[END]
7: (Isis) [7a 65161][13 1, 418000]Now, [Flynn].
Place Osiris' body here.
[END]
8: (Isis) [7a 65161][13 1, 418001]Thank you. Now I can finally
resurrect my husband.
[END]
9: 〉 Isis places her hand over Osiris'
body...
[END]
10: (Osiris) [7a 0][13 1, 412201]Ah, Isis, my lovely wife, you have
finally restored me to life.
[END]
11: (Isis) [7a 0][13 1, 418002]Yes. And it is all thanks to this
human... [Flynn].
[->]He ran all over the place for you,
and even defeated Seth.
[END]
12: (Osiris) [7a 0][13 1, 412200]Is that so? Then you have my thanks,
[Flynn].
[->]If I were to not do anything for you
in return, it would reflect badly on
my dignity as a king.
[->]I shall go with you on your journey,
[Flynn], and aid you.
[->]Is that all right, Isis?
[END]
13: (Isis) [7a 0][13 1, 418003]Very well.
[->]I shall return to our palace and wait
for your return.
[->]I will prepare a banquet to celebrate
the return of our king.
[END]
14: 〉 Isis bows and leaves, looking much
happier than before...
[END]
15: (Osiris) [7a 0][13 1, 412200]A banquet... I will have to look
forward to it.
[->]Now then, [Flynn].
Let us go.
[END]
16: (Osiris) [7a 0][13 1, 412203]Just between you and me...
I'm still missing part of my body.
[->]I'm hoping that I will be able to
find it if I remain in this world.
[->][13 1, 412201]Aha... My wife can never hear of
this, though. Do you understand?
[->]Now then...
[->][13 1, 412210]I am the Deity Osiris, at your
service.
[END]
17: 〉 Osiris has joined you.
[END]
18: (Osiris) [7a 0][13 1, 412209]Oh, it seems as though there is not
enough space for me on your machine.
[->]Very well, I shall wait here.
[END]
19: (Osiris) [7a 0][13 1, 412203]Are you prepared for me to join you?
[END]
20: 〉 A demon's voice speaks from
somewhere...
[END]
21: (Osiris) [7a 0][13 1, 412202]Ah, good. It would appear that
everything is in order.
[END]
22: 〉 You give Osiris' body to Isis...
[END]
23: 〉 According to the map, this place
is called the ”Zojoji Temple.”
[->]〉 It is in ruins, but the air in the
area is pure and fresh...
[END]
24: 〉 You no longer have any business
here...
[END]
25: (Osiris) [7a 0][13 1, 412209]Oh? It seems that a portion of my
spirit already travels with you.
[->]In that case, I shall let that portion
of me do the work of assisting you.
[->][13 1, 412203]Just between you and me...
I'm still missing part of my body.
[->]I'm hoping that I will be able to
find it if I remain in this world.
[->][13 1, 412201]Haha... But, I shall let this spirit
double of mine look for that as well.
[END]
800: (Megami Isis) [7a 65161]Is there no one who will help me find
my husband's body parts, after Seth
scattered them all about the city?
[->][END]
900: 〉 There is no one here...
[END]
901: 〉 The goddess Isis stands here.
She appears to be desperate...
[END]
