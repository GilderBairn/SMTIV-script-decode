0: (Ambitious Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403002]Hey, have you heard the rumors about
Ikebukuro? They say that it's free
from the Ashura−kai's control.
[->]All the Hunters who dislike the
Ashura−kai are heading there.
[->]I haven't heard from anyone who went
there, though. It must be so nice
that they don't want to come back...
[->]I really wish I knew what Ikebukuro
is like.

[->]I heard it used to be a big place for
entertainment. Just thinking about a
place like that fires me up.

2: (Ambitious Hunter) [7a 67]I really want to go!
[->]I might even risk getting eaten by
demons, just for the chance to go
there...
[->]I wonder if anybody has a picture of
Ikebukuro... or something.

3: Show him the camera
Ignore him

4: (Ambitious Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403041]Hey, that's something fancy you've
got there. Would it be possible for
you to take pictures of Ikebukuro?
[->]There are only two places that I
want to see.
[->]First is the most famous building
in Ikebukuro, the sixty−story
Sun Building!
[->]The other place is the Ikebukuro
East Gate, where there is a row of
huge department store buildings!
[->]I'd like you to take pictures of
these two places and show them to
me.

6: (Ambitious Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403031]You look like you're a much better
Hunter than I am. I'm sure you aren't
afraid of going to Ikebukuro at all.
[->]I'm counting on you to bring those
pictures.

8: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 1, 502044]We appear to be in a location that

How was Ikebukuro?

Let me see 'em.

pictures.

20: (Ambitious Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403021]This... this is... Ikebukuro...?
[->]Pools of blood, lakes of poison...
Just pandemonium wherever you look.
Is this the cost of freedom...?
[->]Damn, that was close. I was almost
tricked by the promise of freedom.
I was this close to running off...
[->]The Ashura−kai might get on my nerves
once in a while, but I guess I belong
in Shinjuku.
[->]Well, thanks for the pictures.
You could say you just saved my life.
