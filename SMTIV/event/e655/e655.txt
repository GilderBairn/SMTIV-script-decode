0: (Demon) [7a 65327][13 1, 412107]Hmm... Is there any way I can
retrieve it...?
[->]If it realizes my intention, then it
will become difficult for me to
accomplish anything...
[END]
1: 〉 The demon seems lost in thought...
[END]
2: (Demon) [7a 65327][13 1, 412102]Ah, good, very good.
Your help is much appreciated.
[->]My name is Pabilsag, and I am a
messenger from the lord of the
Babylonian gods, Enlil.
[->](Pabilsag) I would like you to retrieve the
[Color:0x5]Tablet of Heaven's Will.[Color:0x0]
[->]The Tablet of Heaven's Will is a clay
tablet on which the fates of the gods
are written.
[->]Because it holds our destinies, we
gods cannot lay a finger on this
tablet ourselves.
[->][13 1, 412101]That is why I have decided to ask a
human to carry out this task for me.
[->]Anzu is far too weak to maintain his
appearance in this world. I need you
to take the tablet back from him.
[->]I have received information that Anzus
have been seen near a [Color:0x5]red tower[Color:0x0]
in [Color:0x5]Shiba.[Color:0x0]
[->]Once you have obtained the Tablet of
Heaven's Will, please bring it to me.
[END]
3: (Pabilsag) [7a 65327][13 1, 412103]The Anzus have gathered under a
[Color:0x5]red tower[Color:0x0] in [Color:0x5]Shiba.[Color:0x0]
[->]Once you have obtained the Tablet of
Heaven's Will, please bring it to me.

[->]Or... Could it be that you have
obtained the Tablet of Heaven's Will
already?
[END]
5: (Pabilsag) [7a 65327][13 1, 412102]Yes, this is indeed the Tablet of
Heaven's Will. Very good.
[->]I confess, I have always seen humans
as weak and often intractable
creatures.
[->]Perhaps my opinion of your people has
been in error.
[->]I would like to deliver this tablet
to my father Enlil in all haste.
Please, excuse me.
[->]Thank you for your help.

6: 〉 The demon leaves...

7: (Pabilsag) [7a 65327][13 1, 412109]Is there something wrong?
Have you not retrieved it yet?
[->]Once you have obtained the Tablet of
Heaven's Will, please bring it to me.
[END]
8: (Pabilsag) [7a 65327][13 1, 412100]Ah, human. Have you obtained the
Tablet of Heaven's Will?
[END]
9: (Demon) [7a 65327][13 1, 412100]Hmm... A human? Have you come here
in response to the request that my
lord has made?
[END]
10: ”Yes.”
”No.”
[END]
11: (Demon) [7a 65327][13 1, 412107]I see. That is disappointing. Well,
if you have no business here with
me, then I must ask you to leave.
[->]Both of us should spend what time we
have wisely.

900: 〉 There is no one here...
