36: (Burroughs) [7a 2]Which are you going to, the Tokyo
below the ceiling or the Tokyo
covered in desert?
[END]
37: ”The Tokyo below the ceiling.”
”The Tokyo covered in desert.”
”Neither, I think.”

Ichigaya. He really became King...
[->]This isn't a dream, is it? Well, even if
it is...
[->]...It was real while I was having it.
[END]
45: (Male demonoid) [7a 103][13 1, 415101]We took control of the lab. Now we don't
have to worry about neurishers.
[->]We just have to get the neurishers we
brought to give birth to more and more.
[->]Now that our food worries are taken care
of... I'm starting to get an itch for
something else...
[->]I wanna be big−time! If I kill the King,
would that do it...?
[END]
46: (Male neurisher) [7a 107][13 1, 403442]King Akira inspected all the neurishers
of Tokyo and brought only the best here.
[->]I know we're just neurishers... but
being picked out personally by the King,
I feel like we're Adam and Eve.
[->]Someday, our descendants will fill Tokyo.

47: (Female neurisher) [7a 106][13 1, 403501]I may not be able to see, but my hearing
is good. So I can tell...
[->]King Akira is apologizing to me from the
bottom of his heart.
[->]But I'm actually grateful to him.
He gave me−−someone who existed only to
be food−−a role in life.
[->]My role now is to become an offering in
order to build our ideal Tokyo...

631: (King Akira) [7a 85][13 1, 401701]...Oh, it's you, Boss. Sorry, I was...
just doing some thinking.
[->]I finally realized something after I
became the King of Tokyo. When it comes
to who I should be looking out for...
[->]I need to put everyone else first,
right? I mean, I'm the King of Tokyo,
after all.
[->]Having to worry about more than
yourself is harder than a punch to
the gut...
[->]To be honest, I already want to ditch
it all, but I already told my sis
about it... so I gotta stand firm.
