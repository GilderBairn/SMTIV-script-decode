0: (Accented manager) [7a 111][13 1, 405424]...Wait a sec.
[->]You must be here for that thing, but I'm
sorry. We've got reasons why you can't
have any.
[END]
1: (Accented manager) [7a 111]We don't accept any complaints, either.
So I'll have to ask you to leave.
[END]
2: (Demon) [7a 65113][13 1, 412103]You still insist on staying human here
in Shibuya? The birthplace of fashion?
[->]C'mon, eat a Red already and take that
step toward becoming a demon.
[END]
3: (Demon) [7a 65067][13 1, 411001]Reds don't just fill your belly. It's
that... What's it called? Intellectual
curiosity, yeah?
[->]You sense the troubles and joys of
humans, too. It's like slipping into
another world.
[->]It's a kick for us since we live off
reason. Once you get hooked, you can't
eat just one.
[END]
4: (Demon) [7a 65066][13 1, 419100]Looks like my demands helped. Tayama's
finally making a move about the Reds.
[->]He's going to send in a skilled human
to take care of that demon.
[->]Not that I care what he does as long as
he keeps the Reds coming. If he doesn't,
the humans underground look tempting...
[END]
5: (Demon) [7a 65066][13 1, 419100]Looks like my demands helped. Some more
Reds have finally come in.
[->]I guess that skilled human did his job.
[->]I should get going to Club Milton or
my share of the Reds will be gone!
