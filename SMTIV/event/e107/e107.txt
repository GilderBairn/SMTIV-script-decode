0: (Voice) ...Hello.
[END]
1: (Hikaru) [7a 20]We meet again.
[END]
2: (Walter) [7a 4]Hikaru...? Why are you here...?
[END]
3: (Hikaru) [7a 20]...That's what I was gonna ask you.
[->]I'm surprised you came to Ikebukuro
on your own. I mean, It's not like
she told you to.
[END]
4: (Hikaru) [7a 20]Ikebukuro is a bad place for people
who live in Tokyo. It's crawling with
foreign demons!
[->]But it's funny...
[END]
5: (Hikaru) [7a 20]It was the reign of demons, who devour
humans, which protected books from
that man.
[END]
6: (Isabeau) [7a 5]Are you implying that there are books
here...?
[END]
7: (Isabeau) [7a 5]Then I might finally read the rest of
that manga...! Oh, ah... pardon me.
[->]The Black Samurai who smuggled books
into our kingdom may be supplying
them here as well.
[END]
8: (Walter) [7a 4]You traveled all this way only to
tell us that much?
[END]
9: (Hikaru) [7a 20]That's right!
[->]I said I was interested in you guys,
didn't I?
[END]
10: (Hikaru) [7a 20]Okay, I'll be going now. I hope we
meet again!
[END]
11: 〉 Hikaru walked away...
[END]
12: (Walter) [7a 4]Hmph...
[END]
107: (Burroughs) [7a 2]That sounds like my cue, Master.
[->]The quest to ”Capture the Black
Samurai”...
[->]Looks like it's going well.
I'll keep rooting for you.
[END]
