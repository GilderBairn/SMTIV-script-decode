0: (Female Hunter) [7a 82][13 1, 403103]Hey, you're [Flynn], right?
You've got great timing.
[->]I'm friends with Nozomi. I usually
ask her to take some pictures for me.
[->]But it's kind of hard to ask her now,
since there are so many people asking
for her help right now.
[->]I hear that you have a camera too, right?
[->]I've got a favor to ask.
Could you do a little job that
involves taking pictures for me?
[END]
1: Accept it
Refuse
[END]
2: (Female Hunter) [7a 82][13 1, 403133]You're a life saver. So the job I want you
to do is to go take pictures that
I can use as reference material.
[->]You know the shelter in [Color:0x5]Kasumigaseki[Color:0x0]'s
underground? My job is to do periodic
inspections of that place.
[->]So when I give my client, Mr. Fujiwara,
the report, it's easier for me to have a 
picture on hand to help explain things.
[->]So could you go to the underground shelter,
and take a picture of the place for me?
[END]
3: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 1, 502043]We've got another new quest.
I'll register it on the list.
[END]
4: (Female Hunter) [7a 82][13 1, 403143]Well I guess it can't be helped.
I guess I'll ask Nozomi then.
[END]
5: 〉 This is the Counter−Demon Force Base located
within the shelter.
[END]
6: 〉 Will you take a picture?
[END]
7: Yes
No
[END]
8: 〉 You've obtained a picture of the shelter.
[END]
9: 〉 [Flynn] has left the place.
[END]
10: (Female Hunter) [7a 82][13 1, 403102]Oh hey, it's you.
Did you take the picture for me?
[END]
11: Yes
No
[END]
12: 〉 The woman is looking at the picture
of the shelter...
[END]
13: (Female Hunter) [7a 82][13 1, 403131]Yeah, this is perfect.
This should complete my report now.
[END]
14: 〉 [Flynn] has received a reward.
[END]
15: (Female Hunter) [7a 82][13 1, 403133]Thanks for the help [Flynn].
As expected of a photographer in training.
[->]What, you're not?
*sigh* I guess Nozomi's tricked me again.
[->]Well thanks anyways.
Say hi to Nozomi for me if you see her.
[END]
16: (Female Hunter) [7a 82][13 1, 403141]My report's pretty much done,
so all I need now is the photograph to finish it.
[END]
17: (Female Hunter) [7a 82][13 1, 403131]Once you take the picture,
just bring it over to me.
[END]
100: (Female Hunter) [7a 82][13 1, 403122]What am I going to do?
I can't get a picture if Nozomi isn't around.
[->]I guess I'll just have to tell
Mr. Fujiwara to wait a little while...
[END]
900: 〉 Nobody's here...
[END]
