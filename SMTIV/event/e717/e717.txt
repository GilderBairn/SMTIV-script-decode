0: (Master) [7a 29][13 1, 403003]Hey, prentice. Looks like you're
taking part in the little competition
that's up on the board.
[->]Legion Skills can be very powerful
weapons in a Samurai's quiver.
[->]This quest will teach you how to
attain these skills.
[->]Is there anything you wish to know?
[END]
1: ”What is a Legion Skill?”
”How cam I attain Legion Skills?”
”Not really, no.”
[END]
2: (Master) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]Legion Skills are skills that demons
can use when gathered into hordes.
[->]Under a Samurai's command, they are
strong attacks that temporarily
summon a group of demons.
[->]These hordes can be troublesome foes,
but if you can convince one to help
you, it can be a tremendous asset.
[->]If you are going to be a real Samurai,
you should be able to use one or two
Legion Skills.
[END]
3: (Master) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]Legion Skills are attained from
demon hordes.
[->]Hordes are pretty easy to find,
since they look like swarms.
[->]Once you enter battle, try using the
”Scout” command while in conversation
with the demons.
[->]If you are successful, the horde may
”teach” you the Legion Skill.
[->]...This is possible by having them
Whisper the skill to you.
[->]Don't worry; it's not difficult.
If you can make demons your allies
singularly, this is about the same.
[END]
4: (Master) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]Well, according to my information,
demon hordes tend to appear between
the [Color:0x5]3rd and 5th levels[Color:0x0] of Naraku.
[->]Once you have attained a Legion Skill,
come show it to me, and I'll judge
it for you.

6: (Master) [7a 29][13 1, 403003]Hey, prentice. Did you attain a
Legion Skill?
[END]
7: (Master) [7a 29][13 1, 403041]Ah, yes. It seems you do have a
Legion Skill.
[->]Well, well, you've exceeded my
expectations. You're in first place.
[->]We've all been betting on the outcome
of the competition...
[->]Looks like K's gonna take the pot.
That guy sure knows how to pick 'em.
[->]Well, that's the joy of
Challenge Quests.
[->]Good luck to you, prentice.
[END]
8: (Master) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]What's wrong? If you don't hurry,
the others are going to beat you
to it.
[->]Well, according to my information,
demon hordes tend to appear between
the [Color:0x5]3rd and 5th levels[Color:0x0] of Naraku.
[->]Once you have attained a Legion Skill,
come show it to me, and I'll judge

have one?
[END]
10: (Master) [7a 29][13 1, 403002]Is there anything else you wish to
know?
[END]
11: (Master) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]Why don't you ask Mido from the
Cathedral of Shadows? He's the
expert on this sort of thing.
[->]Anyway, first you must obtain a
contract with a demon.
[->]That way, Mido can give you a thorough
explanation on how to fuse demons.
[END]
12: Yes
No
