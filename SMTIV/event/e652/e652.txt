0: (Director) [7a 47][13 1, 403241]From the looks of you... I'd say
you must be human. You're a Hunter,
then?
[->]...Which means that you're here to
be on the show, right?
[END]
1: ”Yes.”
”No.”
[END]
2: (Director) [7a 47][13 1, 403211]Great. We're ready to begin shooting
right away. Are you ready?
[END]
3: (Director) [7a 47][13 1, 403212]Then scram.
[END]
4: ”Yes.”
”No.”
[END]
5: (Director) [7a 47][13 1, 403242]All right! Everybody who's going to
be involved in this episode, gather
'round!
[END]
6: (Director) [7a 47][13 1, 403242]Well, you'd better get ready, and
quick. We're going to be starting
pretty soon.
[END]
7: 〉 A number of Hunters crowd around to
hear the Director speak.
[END]
8: (Director) [7a 47][13 1, 403221]Right, let me explain the rules.
[->]The show's named ”RedxWhite Punchdown
Smacktacular!” Team Red and Team White
are going to fight to the death.
[->]Now, I'm not asking you guys to kill
each other. We're all humans here.
[->]The humans are all on Team White, and
Team Red is all demons. So you should
be used to this sort of thing, right?
[->]The only difference is that you're
gonna be doing it on camera.
[->]Oh, and no rigging the show with your
opponent! Show our viewers the reality
of a Hunter taking down demons!
[->]...I ought to mention that in the last
episode, Team White was obliterated
almost instantly.
[->]I hope I get a better show out of
you guys this time around!
[->]Okay, cameras are rollin'.
[->]The arena for these battles will be
the streets here in east Shinjuku.
[->]We've got the streets locked down
during filming, so don't even think
of running. Fight to the bitter end!
[->]Now get out there and give us some
awesome fights to get our ratings up.
We're live in three... two... one...
[END]
9: (Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403041]Wow, that was something else!
You took on that horde of demons all
on your own!
[->]...Looks like a good portion of us
Hunters have been killed, though...
[->]Still, I'm gonna survive and get my
hands on that prize money!
[END]
10: (Hunter) [7a 69].........
[->].........
[->][13 1, 403013]...Huh!?
[->]I don't remember anything after that
demon started singing.
[->]This lady came into my dreams...
She was so beautiful...
[->]...Uh, wait. Was I in some deep shit
just now?
[->]Well, thanks for killing that demon,
then. You really saved my ass.
[END]
11: (Hunter) [7a 69][13 1, 403021]Dammit! We screwed up!
[->]That demon was so sweet and cute,
everybody underestimated her.
[->]Almost all the Hunters who fell for
her lost their lives.
[->]You managed to keep your cool, though.
[END]
12: ”Yeah.”
”Actually, I didn't.”
”I feel sorry.”
[END]
13: (Hunter) [7a 69][13 1, 403031]You're a true Hunter, buddy!
[->]Let's hunt down the rest of these
demons and get the prize!
[END]
14: (Hunter) [7a 69][13 1, 403042]I see your point. Yeah, huh.
[->]I would've liked to make that demon
my ally, too.
[END]
15: (Hunter) [7a 69][13 1, 403041]You feel sorry... for the demon?
[->]After all those Hunters she killed,
you must be something special to be
able to say that.
[->]I do think you've got a soft heart,
but there's something scary about you.
[END]
16: (Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403042]You're strong, man.
Beating that demon.
[->].........
[->]Y'know, everybody squished by that
demon all had these looks on their
faces right before they died...
[->]It was like... they were incredibly
happy, or caught in a perfect dream,
or something...
[->]Would you be willing to die, if it meant
being able to feel like that?
[END]
17: ”I would love it.”
”You'd die.”
”What the hell are you saying?”
[END]
18: (Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403031]Yeah, I think you and me are gonna
get along just fine.
[->]Still, we'd be dead. But maybe I
wanna be squished...
[END]
19: (Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403042]Yeah, huh...
[->]Still, I get the feeling like those
people figured it was a fair price
to pay for the experience.
[->]I could tell.
[END]
20: (Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403042]Y−Yeah. What was I thinking?
[->]Sorry, I was just wonderin'.
Forget I mentioned it.
[END]
21: (Hunter) [7a 69][13 1, 403002]Man, I can't believe it. You beat
most of the demons yourself.
[->]It's thanks to you that me and a couple
of the other Hunters have been able to
survive this long.
[->]We're almost there! The money is so
close I can almost taste it!
[END]
22: (Hunter) [7a 69][13 1, 403013]What the−−
...Something's coming!
[END]
23: (Announcer) [7a 138][13 1, 406001]Sorry to keep you waiting! It's the
ultimate climax of RedxWhite Punchdown
Smacktacular XIII!
[->]The final demon, the leader of
Team Red, is a god among gods!
[->]One of the primordial goddesses,
Tiamaaaaaaat!
[END]
24: (Announcer) [7a 138][13 1, 406003]We have a winner!
[->]The champion of RedxWhite Punchdown
Smacktacular XIII is.........
[->]Team White!
The Hunters are victorious!
[END]
25: (Announcer) [7a 138][13 1, 406001]That was a heated match!
[->]It was a fight to the death! You'd
better believe we're gonna be digging
plenty of highlights from this one!
[->]Until our next Smacktacular...
So long, everyone!
[END]
26: (Director) [7a 47][13 1, 403231]Good job, good job!
[->][Flynn], buddy, you were great out
there! We should go drinking some time,
on me!
[->]It's good to see Team White win once
in a while, you know? It keeps viewer
numbers up. Great show today!
[->]Everybody else, you did great, too.
Let's all get together for a wrap
party sometime later!
[->]What? Who said that?
...I know I just heard somebody say
”Give us the prize already, asshole!”
[->][13 1, 403211]Fine, you ungrateful little shits.
I was in a good mood and everything.
[->]Here.
[END]
27: 〉 The surviving Hunters take their
share of the rewards...
[END]
28: (Hunter) [7a 69][13 1, 403031]It's thanks to you that we survived
long enough to get this money.
[->]I appreciate it. See you around.
[END]
29: 〉 The other Hunters pay their respects
to [Flynn] and leave...
[END]
30: (Director) [7a 47][13 1, 403212]Action!
What are you doing!? Go!
I want to see blood!
[END]
31: (Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403002]Man, I can't believe it. You beat
most of the demons yourself.
[->]It's thanks to you that me and a couple
of the other Hunters have been able to
survive this long.
[->]We're almost there! The money is so
close I can almost taste it!
[END]
32: (Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403013]What the−−
...Something's coming!
[END]
33: (Staffer) [7a 59][13 1, 403002]Sir, you can't go this way!
We've already started recording!
