0: 〉 An old man stands at the end of
an overpass...
[->]〉 Will you talk to him?
[END]
1: Yes
No
[END]
2: 〉 You leave the area...
[END]
3: 〉 You decide to talk to the old
man...
[END]
4: (Old Man) [7a 63][13 1, 403802]Huh? You got some business with me,
boy?
[->]Oh, I get it. You've come to listen
to my story.
[->]Then let me tell you the story of the
King of Heroes, Wodan, and his search
for the secret of the ancient runes.
[END]
5: 〉 The old man begins his story...
[END]
6: (Voice from afar) [7a 69][13 1, 403021]Hold it right there, asshole!
[END]
7: (Rowdy Hunter) [7a 69][13 1, 403011]I knew you'd show up!
[END]
8: 〉 The Hunter attacks you without
any further explanation...
[END]
9: (Old Man) [7a 63][13 1, 403831]Ha ha ha!
Good, good!
[->]You're pretty strong, boy. It's the
second coming of the King of Heroes,
ha ha ha!
[END]
10: (Woman's voice) [7a 70][13 1, 403123]Stop right there!
[END]
11: (Female Hunter) [7a 70]You showed up, just as that Hunter
Kyuzou said you would.
[->]I guess slaughtering demons isn't
enough for you? Now you're hunting
down humans? That's a new kind of low.
[->]Stay back, old man! I'll protect you!
[END]
12: ”Wait just a moment!”
”You have the wrong man!”
[END]
13: (Female Hunter) [7a 70][13 1, 403111]I won't show any mercy!
Prepare yourself!
[END]
14: 〉 It appears that she is refusing
to listen...
[->]〉 The female Hunter moves to attack!
[END]
15: (Old Man) [7a 63][13 1, 403832]Ahahaha!
Very nice!
[->]You're pretty good, boy. You too,
missy. You remind me of a Valkyrie!
Ha ha ha!
[->]Oh, I'm getting all fired up now.
It makes me want to dance!
[END]
16: (Female Hunter) [7a 70][13 1, 403121]Argh, dammit...
He's too strong.
[END]
17: (Rowdy Hunter) [7a 69][13 1, 403022]Shit, I didn't expect this guy to
be so tough...
[->]It's all over for me now, isn't it?
[->]What the hell was I thinking even
accepting this job...
[END]
18: 〉 It seems that these people had
taken jobs to protect the old man...
[->]〉 You explain the situation to the
other Hunters...
[END]
19: (Female Hunter) [7a 70][13 1, 403142]What...? You took the job to protect
this old guy, too?
[->]...So this whole thing was just a
misunderstanding? Oh, I get it now!
[->]That other guy was going to attack
the old man, and you stopped him!
[END]
20: (Rowdy Hunter) [7a 69][13 1, 403012]Me!? What the hell are you talking
about!? I already said that I came
here because I took the job too!
[->]I know I kind of jumped the gun here,
but you came along and made the same
mistake!
[->]So... Wait, I'm confused.
[->]Does this mean we were supposed to
be allies, fighting somebody else?
[->]Then what the hell are we supposed
to be fighting...?
[END]
21: (Powerful voice) [7a 31][13 1, 413204]Splendid battles... More than enough
to keep me entertained.
[->]I did not expect things to go this
well... You have exceeded my
expectations.
[END]
22: (Mysterious Man) [7a 31][13 1, 413208]It seems we've got some powerful
warriors here.
[->]Especially you, victorious one.
Your skills are almost wasted on a
human.
[END]
23: (Rowdy Hunter) [7a 69][13 1, 403011]Huh? Who the hell are you?
[->]Wait a minute! You're the Hunter
that's after the old guy, aren't you!
[END]
24: (Mysterious Man) [7a 31][13 1, 413208]And if I am?
[->]Would you defeat me?
[->]Even if...
[END]
25: (Demon) [7a 65143][13 1, 413204]I am... the Kishin Thor.
[->](Thor) [7a 65143]Now, to put the finishing touches on
this amusement, I will slaughter you
all.
[->]Your souls will be offered to my
king!
[END]
26: 〉 Something about the old man seems
to be wrong...
[END]
27: 〉 The old man has turned into a
demon named Odin.
[END]
28: (Thor) [7a 65143][13 1, 413202]Ah, King Odin has been resurrected...
My wishes have finally been granted.
[->]Yes, humans... Resurrecting King Odin
was my true intention.
[->]My king was turned into an old man,
stripped of his memories, and forced
to wander the world.
[->]I finally found my king, and thought
of a way to help him regain his
memories.
[->]That is why I took the form of the
Hunter Kyuzou to commission this
fake assignment.
[->][13 1, 413201]You Hunters have displayed your
skills in battle among yourselves.
[->]You have also proven your skill by
besting me in battle.
[->]Thanks to these battles, the king's
memories were reawakened by the
excitement he felt.
[->]I thank you all. The reward I have
for you cannot compare to the
gratitude I have for you Hunters.
[->]First, I will reward the one who
defeated me in battle.
[END]
29: (Thor) [7a 65143][13 1, 413201]Let us return to Asgard, King Odin.
[END]
30: (Odin) [7a 65368][13 1, 413003]I have taken a liking to the humans
here.
[->]I shall give you all the right to
enter Valhalla.
[->]Do not hesitate to come to me when
you die. I shall send a Valkyrie to
you as a messenger.
[->]Farewell.
[END]
31: 〉 Odin and Thor leave...
[END]
32: (Female Hunter) [7a 70][13 1, 403121]Are you telling me that we were all
tricked by demons?
[->]All they think about is themselves...
What do they think we humans are?
[->]Augh, I've had it up to here with
these demons!
[END]
33: (Rowdy Hunter) [7a 69][13 1, 403043]I did receive a reward for this,
but I did almost lose my life, too.
[->]One step in the wrong direction, and
I'd probably have ended up in
Valhalla. No joke...
[->]Well, it's thanks to you that we were
able to survive all this.
[->]So thanks.
[END]
34: 〉 The Hunters leave...
[END]
35: (Odin) [7a 65368][13 1, 413001]Hm...

900: 〉 Nobody's here...
