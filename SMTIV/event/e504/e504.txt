”No.”

4: (Street vendor) [13 1, 403831]Oh, thanks for coming by to look in on
us. We're very grateful for your, um,
services.

5: (Street vendor) Then can you say ”Erawan”?
Come on, say it.

8: (Accented man) [7a 137][13 1, 403631]I don't know how it is anywhere else,
but these are the rules around here.
[->]Your life depends on it too, y'know?
You do see this pocket here, right...?

9: (Reluctant man) [7a 29][13 1, 403021]......
[END]
10: 〉 The reluctant man silently stuffed
some Macca into the accented man's
pocket.

11: (Accented man) [7a 137]This makes you an official Hunter, too.
I wish you good... hm?
[END]
12: (Accented man) [7a 137][13 1, 403621]What're you lookin' at, punkass? Take a
hike if you don't want your nose broken.
[END]
13: (Cheerful man) [7a 60][13 1, 403201]...Huh? Wow, it's rare to see a
youngster like you here.
[->]This is great. Won't you chat with
me for a bit?
[END]
14: ”Very well.”
”No.”
[END]
15: (Cheerful man) [7a 60][13 1, 403233]...Thank you.
[END]
16: (Cheerful man) [7a 60][13 1, 403243]I see... No, don't worry about it.
I'm going to be here for a while.
[END]
17: (Cheerful man) [7a 60]...You see that wooden scaffold
behind me?
[END]
18: (Cheerful man) [7a 60]Back in the day, there was a string
of child kidnappings.
[->]At the time, the police hid the
truth, but the victims' families all
knew what was happening.
[END]
19: (Cheerful man) [7a 60]There used to be a giant cocoon on
top of that scaffold. ...That's where
the children were taken.
[->]It was supposedly an ”ark” created
by the angels to hold those who were
free from the Filth...
[END]
20: (Cheerful man) [7a 60]And, just before that huge ceiling
over Tokyo was formed, the cocoon
went flying off into the sky.
[END]
21: (Cheerful man) [7a 60]That poor child... So frail...
[->]I wonder if he's still alive somehow,
up there above that ceiling...
[END]
22: (Demon) [7a 65430][13 1, 411201]Oh, don't worry. I'm not here to fight.
That aside...
[->]Do you have any Reds? Or do you know
anyone who can hook me up?
[END]
23: (Demon) [7a 65430][13 1, 411201]That reminds me... I wonder how things
are going for those guys who came from
above the Firmament.
[->]This is Tokyo, after all. People here
have forgotten bout God. It's like they
came to get themselves killed.
[END]
24: (Demon) [7a 65430][13 1, 411201]That reminds me... seems like those guys
from above the Firmament got rescued.
[->]They were almost killed, what with them
being powerless and all. I wonder who'd
want to help them out...
[END]
25: (Demon) [7a 65430][13 1, 411201]That reminds me... Those guys from above
the Firmament who were locked up in
Shinjuku National Park...
[->]You're the ones who rescued them, right?
[->]Well, this might not have been what you
bargained for, but you guys are screwed.
[->]You're a buncha humans who stuck your
nose in a fight between demons.
[END]
26: (Demon) [7a 65430][13 1, 411201]I heard the Ashura−kai got stomped. But
then, they were basically a random mob
once their leader died.
[->]The master who made the contract's not
around anymore, so the contract's null
and void too.
[->]Heh... We can do whatever we want now...
[END]
27: (Demon) [7a 65017][13 1, 412101]Eating humans is a thing of the past
nowadays.
[->]Today, it's good manners to eat Reds
instead. It doesn't make a mess like
eating humans does, either.
[END]
28: (Demon) [7a 65017][13 1, 412101]If I remember right, there were these
three who got locked away...
[->]But there were four of them in all.
What happened to that last one...?
[END]
29: (Demon) [7a 65017][13 1, 412101]If I remember right, there were these

What happened to that last one...?
[END]
30: (Demon) [7a 65017][13 1, 412101]I've heard that the four Heralds were
reunited in that Mikado place.
[->]Funny that the witch of the night would
start getting that fearless smile here
in Tokyo around the same time...
[->]Maybe what happened in the past is about
to happen again. *chuckle*
[END]
31: (Demon) [7a 65017][13 1, 412101]I heard that God's chariot has shown up
in that place called Mikado.
[->]God's serious about this. He's not using
man−made weapons this time, but His own
messenger...
[->]I doubt man will survive God's wrath
a second time, heheh...
[END]
32: (Demon) [7a 65419][13 1, 419406]It was humans who made the Reds, but I
heard they don't like eating them.
[->]Why's that? They're so delicious! Humans
just have no taste when it comes to the
finer things.
[END]
33: (Demon) [7a 65419][13 1, 419401]I heard the ones in the tower at Shinjuku
National Park are pretty infamous.
[->]So much so that the anyone who knows
about demons would freak out just to
hear their names...
[->]Though I doubt they're as infamous as
mean, of course.
[END]
34: (Demon) [7a 65419][13 1, 419401]Looks like the ones who were rescued
from Shinjuku National Park are pretty
infamous.
[->]So much so that the anyone who knows
about demons would freak out just to
hear their names...
[->]Though I doubt they're as infamous as
me, of course.
[END]
35: (Demon) [7a 65419][13 1, 419401]The demons those humans have guarding
Camp Ichigaya seem pretty infamous.
[->]So much so that anyone who knows about
the mythology of that Japan place would
grin to hear their names.
[->]Though I doubt they're as infamous as
me, of course.
[END]
36: (Demon) [7a 65419][13 1, 419401]The Demon Lord who resurrected in Camp
Ichigaya is apparently a pretty infamous
demon.
[->]So much so that anyone who's not strong−
willed enough would faint just to hear
his name...
[->]...I probably couldn't stand up to him
either.
[END]
37: (Earthy man) [7a 64][13 1, 403841]Oh, how did you get in here?
Well, that's all right. Just don't
go trampling the plants.
[->]This is the Ashura−kai's farm.
I'm in charge of the produce grown
here.
[->]The plants are malnourished because
the sun doesn't shine here... but
they're still real, farm−grown food.
[END]
38: (Earthy man) [7a 64][13 1, 403841]Oh, how did you get in here?
Well, that's all right. Just don't
go trampling the plants.
[->]This is the Ashura−kai's farm.
I'm in charge of the produce grown
here.
[->]...But if the Ring of Gaea defeats
the Ashura−kai, will this place
belong to the Ring of Gaea's hands?
[END]
39: (Demon) [7a 65108][13 1, 414100]This is the ”holy ground” the angels
set up? Look at all this useless crap
all over the place.
[->]Well, might as well smash it all.
I'll start by devouring the humans.
[END]
40: (Demon) [7a 65108][13 1, 414100](Demon) [7a 65108][13 1, 414100]Humans used to rely on ”God” all the
time, and now they say they rely on
”hope.”
[->]Even though their god betrayed them,
they can't keep themselves from
trusting things to get better.
[->]...Very well, then. I'll take this
feeble ”hope” from the humans.
[END]
41: (土に汚れた男) [7a 60][13 1, 403203](Earthy man) [7a 64][13 1, 403803]I got a message from someone named
Skins. We won't be able to get any
more demon meat from now on...
[->]Also, this farm is going to be
municipally−owned, and we'll be
producing food for everyone here.
[->]A person from the ”Eastern Kingdom
of Mikado” came by earlier and gave
us rice seed... and two pigs!
[END]
42: (Weary man) [7a 59][13 1, 403203]...I ended up joining the Ashura−kai.
I mean, everyone wants to live the
good life, right?
[->]But even in the Ashura−kai, only the
higher−ups get to eat the meat and
vegetables we raise here.
[->]I wonder how many years it'll be
for me to reach that rank...
[END]
43: (Weary man) [7a 59][13 1, 403203]It looks like some guy got into the
tower, so the higher−ups want us to
increase security around here.
[->]They've got to be joking. This
is the guy who killed Xi Wangmu.
What's a rookie like me gonna do?
[->]I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna turn the other way and
keep looking after the chickens...
[END]
44: (Weary man) [7a 59][13 1, 403241]You're the guy who went into the
tower before, right...?
[->]The bosses told us that you're a
guest of Mr. Tayama, so we're not
supposed to do anything to you.
[->]Lucky you. If it were up to me, I'd
wring your neck like a chicken's.
[END]
45: (Weary man) [7a 59][13 1, 403223]To hell with the Ring of Gaea!
We've got Mr. Tayama on the
Ashura−kai's side.
[->]I'm going to stay here and get ready
for the celebration. Time to kill
some chickens and ready the fryer...
[END]
46: (Demon) [7a 65115][13 1, 411101]Yo, human. We're allowed to come
and go as we please now. There's
nowhere you can run to.
[->]Now, you can either kill yourself
before we eat you, or we can eat
you alive. It's your choice.
[END]
47: (Demon) [7a 65115][13 1, 411101]Humans have such pitiful minds.
All this crap about ”hope”...
[->]Don't they realize that it doesn't
change the fact that they're all
going to be eaten by us?
[END]
48: (Grimy woman) [7a 66][13 1, 403312]I was sent here because my husband
comes from a farming family.
[->]I was happy to see him get eaten by
a demon... but now I'm glad that I
married that jerk.
[->]I won't be attacked by demons out
here, and I can eat a scrap of
vegetables once in a while...
[END]
49: (Grimy woman) [7a 66][13 1, 403312]If the Ashura−kai were to go away,
I might be free to leave this farm...
[->]But I don't have think I could
survive in Tokyo if they're out of
the city, too...
[END]
50: (Demon) [7a 65113][13 1, 412101]Ah, young one. May I borrow your
hand for a moment?
[->]Hmm... Your palm has an obvious mark
of death. It seems there is no escape
from your fate.
[->]Trying to resist it will only prolong
your suffering. ...I recommend that
you calmly surrender to us.
[END]
51: (Demon) [7a 65113][13 1, 412101]...Having hope means resisting us
and prolonging one's suffering.
[->]The humans should toss their hope
aside and calmly give in to their
fates by surrendering to us.
