1: (Demon) [7a 65142][13 1, 418004]Welcome, human.
My name is Marici.
[->](Marici) [7a 65142]I have the honor to have been
worshipped by the samurai of old.
[->]Personally, I do not find much joy
in battle...
[->]But, to be worshipped is an
invigorating experience. So, I accept
and appreciate their devotion.
[->][13 1, 418003]And now that a new, modern Samurai
has appeared, this city has become
much more comfortable to me.
[->]That is why I would like to lend a
hand to the Samurai.
[->]If you wish, I shall give you a
lesson on the art of battle.
Would you like to spar with me?
[END]
2: ”It would be an honor.”
”I must refuse for now.”

3: (Marici) [7a 65142][13 1, 418001]Very well.
Then let us get started.
[->]En garde!
[END]
4: (Marici) [7a 65142][13 1, 418002]I see.
Very well.
[->]Come back when you are ready. I will
be willing to train you any time.

[END]
6: (Marici) [7a 65142][13 1, 418003]I see. I have taken measure of your
skill...
[->]If there are more humans like you,
who wield such great power...
[->]...then I suppose there is little
need for me to train them.
[->]Now, then, I suppose I will return to
the palace of my master, Lord Surya.
[->]If you desire my aid, all you have
to do is call for me.
[->]I shall come immediately to your
side.

9: (Old Man) [7a 0][13 1, 403831]Well, hello, lad. How's it going?
Me? Oh, I'm just looking for someone.
[->]There's a rumor that there's a
gorgeous woman who appears around
here.
[->]If these rumors are true, then I just
have to lay my eyes on her beauty.
Otherwise, I'll never die happy.
