0: (Isis) [7a 65161][13 1, 418003]So, you are the one who has come to
hear my request.
[->]As I said, the coffin of my husband,
Osiris, has drifted all the way to
Naraku.
[->]If you return the coffin to me, I
shall reward you.
[->]Unfortunately... I do have ill news
in that regard.
[->]The Vile Seth, who threw the coffin
into the river in the first place,
will be in Naraku as well.
[->]If you try to leave with Osiris'
coffin, Seth is certain to come
after you.
[->]No human can stand against him.
My advice to you is to run as fast
as you can, before he catches you.
[->]It will be an onerous task, but I
have faith in you. I wish you good
fortune.
[END]
1: 〉 You have found a beautifully
decorated sarcophagus. This must be
the coffin of Isis' husband, Osiris.
[END]
2: 〉 You have decided to carry Osiris'
coffin along with you.
[END]
3: (Isis) [7a 65161][13 1, 418004]Oh... Osiris! You found him...
Thank you so much.
[->]As long as I have his remains in my
possession, I'm sure I can protect
him from Seth's grasp.
[->]I doubt that Seth will give up that
easily, though. I must stay on my
toes for a while.
[->]But, now then... Allow me to reward
you for your service. You have my
gratitude.
[END]
4: 〉 Isis thanks [Flynn] and
leaves...
[END]
5: 〉 While carrying the coffin, only
the ”Run” and ”Next” commands will
be available to [Flynn] in battle.
[->]〉 If [Flynn] takes damage, the
coffin will take damage as well.
[END]
100: (Isis) [7a 65161][13 1, 418003]Osiris' coffin should have drifted
along a river to somewhere within
Naraku.
[->]Please, beware of Seth. You cannot
possibly stand a chance against him.
[->]It will be an onerous task, but I
have faith in you. I wish you good
fortune.
[END]
200: (Isis) [7a 65161]It will be an onerous task, but I
have faith in you. I wish you good
fortune.
[END]
400: 〉 [Flynn] let go of Osiris'
sarcophagus during the intense
battle...
[->]〉 The coffin has likely returned by
the power of Osiris to where it had
been found before.
[END]
900: 〉 No one is here...
[END]
901: 〉 Lady Isis stands here, grieving...
[END]
