0: (Master) [7a 29][13 0, 607000]I appreciate your accepting this
quest. This is the Gauntlet in
question...
[->][13 0, 607001]I will warn you beforehand, this is
like to be a fierce battle for you.
[->][13 0, 607002]If you lack confidence in your
abilities, there is no shame in
admitting so. Are you sure?
[END]
1: ”I am prepared.”
”Let me come back later.”
[END]
2: (Master) [7a 29][13 0, 607003]Hm... Very well. Let me explain the
situation regarding this Gauntlet,
then.
[->][13 0, 607004]The problem we have with this Gauntlet
is that there is a powerful demon
within it.
[->][13 0, 607005]This demon is preventing us from using
the Gauntlet as it is meant to be.
[->][13 0, 607006]The Monastery orders that a Gauntlet
must be cleansed before a novice
attempts the Rite using it.
[->][13 0, 607007]However, the demon inside that one
Gauntlet is opposed to being removed.
[->][13 0, 607008]He will only respect the will of one
stronger than he. Many Samurai have
challenged him, but none can best him.
[->][13 0, 607009]Please, defeat the demon inside this
machine for the sake of your future
comrades.
[->][13 0, 607010]Now... Let me get someone to activate
the Gauntlet.
[END]
3: 〉 One of the initiates is selected
to activate the Gauntlet...
[END]
4: (Summoned Demon) [7a 65177][13 0, 607011]Another challenger, I see...
My name is Ares.
[->](Ares) [7a 65177][13 0, 607012]Anyone who is unable to overcome a
warrior such as myself does not
deserve to live.
[END]
5: (Master) [7a 29][13 0, 607013]I see. Well, it is up to you.
You are welcome to come back whenever
you feel ready.
[END]
6: (Ares) [7a 65177][13 0, 607014]You have proven to me that your power
is greater than that of my late master.
[->][13 0, 607015]Very well, you have my approval.
There is no reason for me to remain
within this machine.
[->][13 0, 607016]Farewell, formidable opponent.
May the next time we meet in battle
be as allies.
[END]
7: 〉 The demon leaves...
[END]
8: (Master) [7a 29][13 0, 607017]That was an amazing battle!
Even that demon was impressed
by your skill.
[->][13 0, 607018]Now we can use this Gauntlet again.
If I have another task that needs
doing, I hope you will assist us.
[END]
9: 〉 The demon that appears seems to be
some sort of gladiator...
[->]〉 The summoned demon turns its back
on the Gauntlet and raises its weapon...
[END]
