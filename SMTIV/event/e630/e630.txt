0: (Setanta) [7a 65293][13 1, 411100]Huh...? Hey, you!
My master sent you, didn't he?
[END]
1: ”Yes.”
”No.”
[END]
2: (Setanta) [7a 65293][13 1, 411106]Finally! You should know that I'm
in a really bad mood right now.
[->]Why the hell do I have to be turned
into a kid again just to teach me
the ”way of the warrior”?
[->]And who the hell wants to bother to
learn how humans fight, anyway!? I'll
show you how a true warrior kills!
[END]
3: (Setanta) [7a 65293][13 1, 411107]What the−−!? Now you're just
confusing me. Get out of here!
[END]
4: (Setanta) [7a 65293][13 1, 411103]Damn! I was not expecting that.
You kept your cool, even in an
intense battle like that.
[->]I guess that's what my master was
trying to teach me. Never lose
yourself in battle.
[END]
5: (Scathach) [7a 65499][13 1, 419305]Well... You've finally figured it
out. You're one troublesome student,
you know.
[->]Ah, you would be [Flynn].
Thank you for helping us.
[->]It would seem that my disciple
realized what he was missing, thanks
to your little fight here.
[->]I'm sure that Cu Chulainn will stop
losing himself in bloodlust now.
[END]
6: (Cu Chulainn) [7a 65315][13 1, 412003]I am sorry for causing you such
trouble, Master. I was acting
immature...
[->][Flynn]...
[->]It is all thanks to you that I have
been able to rethink my ways.
[->]I shall train myself in the true ways
of the warrior, and obtain even
greater power.
[END]
7: (Scathach) [7a 65499][13 1, 419304]Well, I've got a little something
for you as a reward. I'm sure it
will come in handy.
[END]
8: 〉 Scathach used her powers to return
Setanta to his true form as
Cu Chulainn.
[END]
9: 〉 According to the map, this place
is called ”Bugeikan.”
[->]〉 The air is filled with the scent
of blood...
[END]
10: 〉 You no longer have any business
in this place.
[END]
100: (Setanta) [7a 65293][13 1, 411108]What the hell... It's you!
You're the guy my master sent, right?
[END]
900: 〉 Speak to Setanta to begin the
battle.
[END]
901: When Setanta loses the battle, he
becomes humble. Scathach appears
and returns Setanta to Cu Chulainn.
[END]
999: 〉 No one is here...
[END]
