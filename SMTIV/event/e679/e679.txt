hatred from my mind.
[->]It seems that some entity was trying
to control me, the ruler of the
Yomotsu−kuni.
[->]I believe that it wants to control
the rulers of the underworlds, in
order to kill off all humanity...

envies all the living, and wishes for
their deaths...
[->]And that was taken advantage of...

so that neither one is wiped out.
