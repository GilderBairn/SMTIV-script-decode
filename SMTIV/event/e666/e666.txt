4: (Male client) [7a 97][13 1, 403642]It appears that you've exterminated
the demons.
[->]I must admit, I had my suspicions
about you at first, warrior from
another world...
[->]But, after seeing how much you have
helped us, I've realized that I was
wrong. I apologize for my rudeness.
[END]
5: (Male client) [7a 97][13 1, 403633]You have my thanks.
[->]They might come back again later on...
[->]But if that happens, I'll try your
techniques out on them. I'm not going
to sit back and let them rob me!

6: 〉 The client leaves...

7: (Male client) [7a 97][13 1, 403601]It seems you've helped us out again.
[->]This isn't much, but I'm extremely
grateful for your help.

8: (Male client) [7a 97][13 1, 403641]If you ever have time, please help us
by getting rid of those demons again.

10: (Shelter inhabitant) [7a 97][13 1, 403203]Are you the guy willing to fight
Tlazolteotl for us?
[->]Rumor has it that this demon only
eats people. She's got all this corn,
and she's not even gonna eat it!
[->]So, it's far better for us to have
that corn than for it to go to waste.
Don't you agree?
[->]Well, I'm not hiring you to talk
philosophy. I've made it so this
terminal will get you to Ikebukuro.
[->]I'm sorry, but that's all I can do.
I'll leave the fighting to a pro like
yourself.
[END]
11: (Shelter inhabitant) [7a 97][13 1, 403242]The terminal to get you to Ikebukuro
should be in Kasumigaseki.
[->]We'll head over there soon as well.
Head to Ikebukuro once you're ready.
