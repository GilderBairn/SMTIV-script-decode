0: 〉 Wu Kong has escaped...
[END]
1: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 1, 502044]It seems the demon's run off to a
different floor.
[->]I've locked onto the demon's signal.
I'll display its location on the
navigation map.
[->]You can use the navigation map to
see the other floors.
[->]Try using it now to find where that
demon is now.
[END]
2: 〉 α2ROM will not display the demon's
signal.
[->]〉 In the final game, the demon's
location will be marked on your map.
[->]〉 But, for now, go to B4 of Naraku,
because that's where the demon is.
Trust us!
[END]
3: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 1, 502044]I still have a lock on the demon's
signal.
[->]Let us be sure to defeat it this time.
[END]
4: 〉 The demon's marker has moved to [Color:0x5]B7.[Color:0x0]
[->]〉 Proceed to [Color:0x5]B7[Color:0x0] of Naraku.
[->]〉 By the way, in the full version,
the marker will randomly move around
the area.
[->]〉 Defeat the demon before it moves
again.
[END]
5: (Wu Kong) [7a 65181][13 1, 411008]Alright! Alright! I give up!
I'll go quietly.
[->]Pfah... I was expecting a god to come
down from the heavens and come after
me. I never thought a human would...
[->]Not even Buddha would have expected
this.
[->]Are you sure you're not under some
sort of divine protection or something?
[->]...Well, I guess it really doesn't
matter to me.
[END]
6: 〉 A majestic voice speaks forth from
the heavens above...
[END]
7: (Majestic voice) [13 1, 413200]So, you have caught Wu Kong.
[->]I am Erlang Shen. I praise you on the
splendid work you have done.
[->](Erlang Shen) Not only is the Jade Emperor pleased,
but so are the rest of the gods of
the heavens.
[END]
8: (Wu Kong) [7a 65181][13 1, 411011]Damn. Well, you caught me. Looks like
it's time for me to go back.
[->]After all, I am the famous Wu Kong!
[->]I still have my honor. I'm not going
to cry about losing to a human.
That sort of thing is beneath me.
[->]Well, I'll see you around.
Don't let yourself loose too much.
[END]
9: 〉 The demon leaves.
