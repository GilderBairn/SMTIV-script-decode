0: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 0, 502025]Let me give you a few things to watch
out for about Challenge Quests.
[END]
1: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 0, 502026]Challenge Quests are only registered
to the list...
[->][13 0, 502027]So if you don't accept it, the quest
doesn't count as being started.
[->][13 0, 502028]I can explain how to accept them if
you want. Need me to tell you?
[END]
2: Yes
No
[END]
3: (バロウズ) [7a 2]オッケー いいわよ
[END]
4: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 0, 502031]Understood. I'll skip over that.
[->][13 0, 502032]Let's surprise everyone and be the
first to finish the Challenge Quests!
[END]
5: Challenge quests other than those where
you must turn in items, such as those
where you must slay certain demons, must
be accepted from the list.
[->]Select Quests from the menu screen and
then select Challenge Quest.
[END]
6: First, select the demon−slaying quest,
[Color:0x5]The Lion's Roar Within Naraku.[Color:0x0] The other
two quests are item delivery quests, so
there is no need to accept them.
[END]
7: You are now done accepting the
Challenge Quest.
[->]During Challenge Quests, normal quests will
be put on hold. If you wish to proceed with
normal quests, you are free to [Color:0x5]abandon[Color:0x0] the
current Challenge Quest at any time.
[->]Also, in regards to Challenge Quest
rewards, if you already have the maximum
allowed number of that item, [Color:0x5]you will be
unable to obtain it.[Color:0x0]
[END]
8: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 0, 502029]That's all the support I have for you this
time.
[->][13 0, 502030]Let's surprise everyone and be the
first to finish the Challenge Quests!
[END]
10: Challenge quests other than those where
you must turn in items, such as those
where you must slay certain demons, must
be accepted from the list.
[->]These types of quests will not progress
unless they are accepted. 
[Color:0x5]Lion's roar echoing in Naraku[Color:0x0] counts as one, but it has already been accepted.
[->]During Challenge Quests, normal quests will
be put on hold. If you wish to proceed with
normal quests, you are free to [Color:0x5]abandon[Color:0x0] the
current Challenge Quest at any time.
[->]Also, in regards to Challenge Quest
rewards, if you already have the maximum
allowed number of that item, [Color:0x5]you will be
unable to obtain it.[Color:0x0]
[END]
900: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 0, 400055]Did you get all that?
[END]
901: ”I did.”
”Let's have it again.”
[END]
902: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 0, 400056]All right. I'll display the
information once more.
