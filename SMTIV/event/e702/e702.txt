0: (Demon) [7a 65496][13 1, 417007]Who are you?
Are you... after me?
[END]
1: 〉 [Flynn] explains the reason he
came here.
[END]
2: (Demon) [7a 65496][13 1, 417001]Brigid sent you?
Whew, I'm saved!
[->]My name's Fortuna.
I'm an old friend of Brigid.
[->](Fortuna) [7a 65496]It'd be bad if an angel caught us
here, so I'll be quick and tell you
what's going on.
[->]This is [Color:0x5]Dagda's Cauldron.[Color:0x0]
Some people mistakenly call it the
Holy Grail.
[->]We snuck into their main stronghold
to take back the Cauldron, which had
been stolen from us, but...
[->]Everyone was killed by the angels...
Everyone but me, that is...
[->]I have to get the Cauldron back,
but I'm too hurt to go any further.
[->]But now that you're here, I get the
feeling that our plan may yet succeed.
[->]Please, take Dagda's Cauldron to
Brigid before the angels find you!
[END]
3: 〉 Fortuna presses Dagda's Cauldron
into [Flynn]'s hands...
[END]
4: (Fortuna) [7a 65496]Dagda's Cauldron is old and somewhat
fragile.
[->]If it breaks, bring it back to me
and I will repair it for you.
[->]I still have the power to do that...
[END]
5: 〉 [Flynn] will now carry Dagda's
Cauldron.
[END]
6: 〉 While carrying the Cauldron,
[Flynn] can only perform the Run
and Next actions in battle.
[->]〉 In addition, if [Flynn] is hurt,
Dagda's Cauldron will also take
damage.
[END]
7: (Fortuna) [7a 65496][13 1, 417008]Did you break Dagda's Cauldron?
Fine, let me see it.
[END]
8: 〉 Fortuna's magic has returned Dagda's
Cauldron to its original state.
[END]
9: (Fortuna) [7a 65496]I'm sure it'll work out this time.
You can do it!
[END]
10: (Fortuna) [7a 65496][13 1, 417007]I tried to do this task for my
friend, it ended kind of pathetically.
[->]It's killing me to admit it, but
you're the only one I can count on
now. Please get it to Brigid.
[END]
11: 〉 Dagda's Cauldron has broken.
[->]〉 You must go back to Fortuna to have
it repaired.
[END]
12: (Demon) [7a 65494][13 1, 418003]Thank you for accepting the quest.
My name is Brigid.
[->](Brigid) [7a 65494]My task for you is to bring me
Dagda's Cauldron.
[->]My kin have risked their lives in
order to recover the Cauldron, which
was stolen from us...
[->]While those who went to retrieve it
could not bring it here, they were
able to bring it to Naraku.
[->]I believe that the goddess [Color:0x5]Fortuna[Color:0x0]
is currently in possession of the
Cauldron at the moment.
[->]There's not much time left. I will
explain my reasons later. For now, I
want you to bring me Dagda's Cauldron.
[END]
13: (Brigid) [7a 65494][13 1, 418003]Megami Fortuna should be somewhere
in the cavern known as Naraku.
[->]Please obtain Dagda's Cauldron from her,
and bring it here.
[END]
14: (Demon) [7a 65494][13 1, 418004]That is Dagda's Cauldron!
[->]So you saw the quest, and brought me
the Cauldron? Thank you so much.
[->]My name is Brigid, a member of the
Tuatha De Danann.
[->](Brigid) [7a 65494]Excuse me, but do you know if the
others are still alive...?
[END]
15: (Brigid) [7a 65494][13 1, 418004]That is Dagda's Cauldron!
[->]So you retrieved it from Fortuna
and brought it here.
[->]Excuse me, but... Do you know if the
others are still alive...?
[END]
16: 〉 [Flynn] explains what he had been
told by Fortuna...
[END]
17: (Brigid) [7a 65494][13 1, 418007]I see... Everyone but Fortuna...
[->]......
[->]We were all prepared for this. Now I
must finish the task that we all set
out to accomplish.
[->]I will take Dagda's Cauldron from
here.
[END]
18: 〉 [Flynn] hands Dagda's Cauldron
to Brigid...
[END]
19: (Brigid) [7a 65494][13 1, 418001]Thank you. 
[END]
20: 〉 Brigid places Dagda's Cauldron
atop an altar in the atrium hall.
[->]......
[->]......
[->]......
[END]
21: (Brigid) [7a 65494][13 1, 418003]Thank you, human.
[->]Now, my only goal is to protect the
Cauldron until the resurrection of
our mother, Danu.
[->]The Lady Danu shall soon return to
us... I have seen the signs.
[->]Once the Cauldron is in Lady Danu's
possession, our race will flourish
once again.
[->]Soon our fallen will be resurrected,
and we will once again be able to
live in peace.
[->]This is all thanks to your aid...
[->]Thank you so much.
[END]
22: (Brigid) [7a 65494][13 1, 418002]I shall protect the Cauldron until
the return of our mother, Lady Danu.
[->]On that day, our race, the Tuatha De
Danann, shall flourish once more...
[END]
23: (Brigid) [7a 65494][13 1, 418006]What is the matter?
[END]
24: 〉 [Flynn] decides to step outside
for now...
[END]
25: (Brigid) [7a 65494][13 1, 418003]I shall take Dagda's Cauldron from
your care.
[END]
26: 〉 Brigid has returned...
[END]
27: 〉 According to the map, this place
is called the International
Convention Center.
[->]〉 The enormous empty space is
filled with silence...
