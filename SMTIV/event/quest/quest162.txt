0: I want you to rescue a certain old man. He is
being targeted by some unruly Hunters. He was
the one that kept everyone together after the
demons started appearing. We can't lose him!
If you're going to help us, come to the overpass
in [Color:0x5]Miyashita Park[Color:0x0] in Shibuya. Watch
out for those Hunters on the way there.
