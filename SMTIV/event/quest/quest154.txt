0: I am interested in the sign of a god named
”Luis Witon,” who was worshipped by the
people of Japan in ancient times. Apparently,
his altar is in a special store in [Color:0x5]Ginza.[Color:0x0]
Can you reach his temple and take a picture 
of [Color:0x5]Luis Witon[Color:0x0] and bring it to me? I'll be in
the Yaesu underground tunnel in Tokyo Station.
