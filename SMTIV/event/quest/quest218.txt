0: I have been considering leaving my home in
Ginza to test my strength in new and exciting
places. Since I am leaving and will no longer
have a use for it, I'm going to give away this
[Color:0x5]Black Card[Color:0x0] to the first person who brings
me a [Color:0x5]Silver Coin[Color:0x0] to remind me of home.
