0: Capture the Black Samurai, who has disseminated
[Color:0x5]Literature[Color:0x0] in the [Color:0x5]mystic script[Color:0x0] in our kingdom,
causing the people to degenerate into demons.
The Black Samurai may have ties with the [Color:0x5]Unclean
Ones. You must [Color:0x5]investigate their country in the
depths of Naraku,[Color:0x0] even though it violates this
”Samurai code” you hold in such esteem.

2: I have reviewed Burroughs' log and the images
contained therein. The battle attire called a
[Color:0x5]Demonica[Color:0x0] is very similar to the portrait of the
Black Samurai drawn from the people's testimony.
It seems my judgement was correct... I must ask
that you [Color:0x5]continue searching Tokyo for her.[Color:0x0]
[END]
3: I have reviewed Burroughs' log. It seems you
have learned valuable information from the
Unclean Ones. This [Color:0x5]Juraku Bookstore[Color:0x0] in the place
called [Color:0x5]Ikebukuro[Color:0x0] may be the origin of the
Literature the Black Samurai introduced into
Mikado. Please, [Color:0x5]continue searching Tokyo for her.[Color:0x0]
[END]
4: Burroughs' note:
If you're going to search Tokyo, then you'll
need access to everywhere... and it seems like
this [Color:0x5]thing with the Corpses[Color:0x0] is keeping us from
having that access. From what the heavily
accented man said, it's probably a [Color:0x5]quest.[Color:0x0]
[END]
5: I have reviewed Burroughs' log. It seems you have
assisted in an Unclean One's quest. Do remember
that your ultimate goal is the capture of the
Black Samurai. This [Color:0x5]Juraku Bookstore[Color:0x0] in the place
called [Color:0x5]Ikebukuro[Color:0x0] seems suspicious, no? Then you
know what must be done.
