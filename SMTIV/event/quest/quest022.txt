0: I would have you [Color:0x5]rescue three of our allies, held
prisoner at Shinjuku National Park.[Color:0x0] Tokyo is a land
where the Lord's grace has no purchase; our allies
were thus unable to wield their full might and
easily overtaken by the culprits. Take care when
attempting this rescue.

1: Dummy
[END]
2: Bless you for rescuing the [Color:0x5]first[Color:0x0] ally. [Color:0x5]Two[Color:0x0] more
remain in captivity. I hope that you will continue
your strenuous efforts on their behalf.
[END]
3: That was the [Color:0x5]second[Color:0x0] ally. Only [Color:0x5]one[Color:0x0] remains in
captivity. I am certain that if you continue your
strenuous effort, he shall shortly be freed.
[END]
4: You have now delivered all of our allies from
bondage. I thank you on the Lord's behalf.
 
I hesitate to ask this, as you must surely be
tired, but I have another favor to ask of you.
[Color:0x5]Please come to the Monastery.[Color:0x0]
