0: Rather than the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado granted
by God, or the demonâˆ’haunted Tokyo, humanity will
get their everyday world back. But first, you need
to [Color:0x5]defeat God's chariot and the Demon Lord to
remove the ceiling over Tokyo.[Color:0x0] I'm sure the goddess
of Tokyo is dying to meet you, Master [Flynn].

2: All that remains now is the Demon Lord. But where
could he be? Come to think of it, we haven't heard
anything about his whereabouts. But [Color:0x5]considering
he's the lord of demons, he must be somewhere
related to them.[Color:0x0] Sorry, Master [Flynn],
but that's all I have for you. You'll have to
find him on your own.
[END]
3: Finally, we have both the Great Spirit of Goodwill
and the Great Spirit of Spite. The time for you to
meet her has come at last. Come on, Master Isabeau
is waiting! Let's hurry and [Color:0x5]go to Shinjuku.[Color:0x0]
