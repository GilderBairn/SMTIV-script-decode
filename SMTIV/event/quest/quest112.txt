0: My son [Color:0x5]Timothy[Color:0x0] has been missing since
yesterday. He was pretending to be a Samurai
and went out to play, but has not come back.
He used to play in Kiccigiorgi Forest, but that
place is now filled with demons... and I'm
worried. I will wait at the [Color:0x5]city outskirts.[Color:0x0]
