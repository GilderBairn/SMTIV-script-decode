0: I want to leave Shinjuku and make Ikebukuro
my new base of operations. A city free from
the Ashuraâˆ’kai sounds like Heaven! But I want
to know what kind of place Ikebukuro is. Please
take two [Color:0x5]pictures[Color:0x0] for me: of the [Color:0x5]really tall
building[Color:0x0] and of the [Color:0x5]train station east gate.[Color:0x0]
Once you've got those pictures, come see me.
I'll be near Shinjuku's west gate.
