0: Pardon my abruptness, but I have issued a quest
to you and Walter. I hope you'll pardon my doing so
in a quest outline, but I'd like to apologize for
my earlier rudeness to you. I wish to hone my own
skills alongside you. There were [Color:0x5]three Challenge
Quests[Color:0x0] posted to the [Color:0x5]blackboard[Color:0x0] earlier; [Color:0x5]complete
them all and return to K's Tavern.[Color:0x0]
