0: I appreciate the difficulties in searching for a
single woman in a strange land. So I have issued
a quest that may benefit you: [Color:0x5]find the base of
this ”Counter−Demon Force”[Color:0x0] somewhere in Tokyo. I
suspect it is related to the Black Samurai... There
ought to be [Color:0x5]useful data there,[Color:0x0] so I ask that
you retrieve it as well.

2: I have reviewed Burroughs' log. It seems that you
have learned important information from the Unclean
Ones. Across the river from the place called [Color:0x5]Ueno[Color:0x0]
is [Color:0x5]Kasumigaseki,[Color:0x0] where it would appear that
the [Color:0x5]Counter−Demon Force Base[Color:0x0] is located. If you
need to complete a quest in order to cross the river,
then do so with my blessing.
