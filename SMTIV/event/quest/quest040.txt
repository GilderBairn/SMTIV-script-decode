0: [Color:0x5]Offer the Great Spirit of Hope[Color:0x0] as a substitute
for my lost powers. When the [Color:0x5]chalice[Color:0x0] is brimming
with the hopes of the people of Tokyo, the Great
Spirit of Hope shall appear.

1: Dummy

2: A ”champion,” eh? Humans dream up such delightful
things. If you truly wish to bring hope to the
world of man, then it must be a man who delivers
it, not any god or demon. Will you [Color:0x5]assume the
throne of this ”champion”?[Color:0x0]
[END]
3: Your title of ”champion” brings hope that elicits
spontaneous hosannas from the people. Even my ”new
emperor” could not accomplish this. That is why
hope will surge wherever you go. I suggest that
you [Color:0x5]bring the people hope by showing your
personage across the lands.[Color:0x0]
[END]
4: I see that you have in your possession the Great
Spirit of Hope. The hopes of all Tokyo's peoples
are within your hands. Hurry and [Color:0x5]bring the Great
Spirit of Hope to me.[Color:0x0]
[END]
