0: My kindred spirit who received God's love yet
turned your back on Him... let us [Color:0x5]go through
Naraku to the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado.[Color:0x0] Together
with the [Color:0x5]Demon Lord,[Color:0x0] you will make the law of power
known to the wouldâˆ’be rulers of the world that would
bind our wills. God's chariot will seek to stop us,
but remember that Walter, through me, is with you.
