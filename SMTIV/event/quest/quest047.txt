0: A Samurai must keep up his strength, so I've made
a quest of this too. 'Tis fine weather today, so
we'll breakfast out of doors. I prefer rice porridge
for breakfast, but I don't care for it without any
fish in. Jonathan has waxed eloquent about a local
[Color:0x5]bakery[Color:0x0] in the castle town; let's go there first to
[Color:0x5]buy some bread.[Color:0x0]

2: We begged off of the baker's ravings and are
making steady progress on the breakfast quest,
having acquired three loaves of bread. As we're
already out and about, I think we should go
somewhere with a [Color:0x5]nice view[Color:0x0] to [Color:0x5]eat our breakfast.[Color:0x0]
Have you any suggestions, [Flynn]?
