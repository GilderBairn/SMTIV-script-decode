0: [Color:0x5]Pluto Castle[Color:0x0] is [Color:0x5]southeast from Shinjuku, near
Kasumigaseki.[Color:0x0] [Color:0x5]You need to overthrow Pluto the
Tormentor[Color:0x0] there. I used to be pretty hot at
handling demons, but I don't have the strength
to fight Pluto. I've got to trust in you
Messiahs from another world.

We've beaten Pluto the Tormentor, so let's go
claim our prize. Master [Color:0x5]Akira[Color:0x0] in Shinjuku has
it, right?
