0: After crossing the river from Ueno to the north...
A demon called the Fury [Color:0x5][Demon name 1][Color:0x0] has been
rampaging in the Ouji area. We demon hunters
don't dare to even enter the area now.
I'm trying to put a group of hunters together
to take it down. Let's meet up at the
[Color:0x5]Ambassador Cafe[Color:0x0] near Ameyoko in the Ueno District.
