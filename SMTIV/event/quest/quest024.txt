0: I want you to [Color:0x5]kill Yuriko,[Color:0x0] that scary broad
who's after the Ashura−kai's [Color:0x5]Yamato Reactor.[Color:0x0]
She wants to put a lockdown on our electricity.
You've offed plenty of demons up to now, so one
woman shouldn't be so hard, right? The Ring of
Gaea's temple is in Tsukiji. You can get there
through Tokyo Station.
[END]
1: Dummy
[END]
2: I've been keeping tabs on you through this
Gauntlet thing your pal has. I'm impressed you
beat some of those Gaea folks. I almost wish
you were on my team. Keep going and [Color:0x5]take the
entrance test,[Color:0x0] and say hi to Yuriko for me.
[END]
3: Burroughs' note:
 
Yuriko seems like a shrewd woman. This isn't
the best situation for us, but you definitely
seem to be getting closer to your goal. Go on
through the [Color:0x5]Passage of Ethics[Color:0x0] to see her.
[END]
4: I don't give a damn if Yuriko's this ”Black
Samurai” or not. She's a menace to both Tokyo
and the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado. Hurry and
bump her off already.
