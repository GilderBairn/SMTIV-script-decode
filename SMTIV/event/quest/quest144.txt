0: This is Hope. I am pushing for a policy to have
the Samurai equipped with mystic relics.
In an area north of Shibuya is a place called
[Color:0x5]Harajuku.[Color:0x0] I have heard that an organization
similar to the Samurai, known as the ”police,”
stockpiled them there. Your mission is to retrieve a
large amount of mystic relics known as [Color:0x5]guns[Color:0x0] there.
That is all.
