0: I registered your exchange with your fellow Samurai
as a quest. Looks like that [Color:0x5]Tayama[Color:0x0] guy is calling
you out. It was a pretty simple message, though...
Anyway, you just need to get to [Color:0x5]Shibuya.[Color:0x0]

1: Dummy

2: I got a signal from a deep−voiced guy called Tayama,
from the Ashura−kai. You're supposed to go to [Color:0x5]Club
Milton[Color:0x0] in [Color:0x5]Shibuya,[Color:0x0] right? Apparently you need to
[Color:0x5]meet with one of his ”boys”[Color:0x0] there. I've heard of
Club Milton before, but the data I had on it was
corrupted. Sorry, but you'll have to find it on
your own, Master [Flynn].
