0: I'd like help with finding weapons for Hunters.
We need more [Color:0x5]firearms[Color:0x0] to deal with the
rising number of demons here. There should be
a JGSDF supply depot buried next to the giant
wall [Color:0x5]north of Ikebukuro.[Color:0x0] The [Color:0x5]Jujo[Color:0x0]
area in the Kita district has barely been
explored, so you'll likely find something there.
