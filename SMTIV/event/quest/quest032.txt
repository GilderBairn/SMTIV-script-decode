0: Let's go [Color:0x5]kill Kenji at Camp Ichigaya.[Color:0x0] Tokyo
doesn't need two kings, after all. Word is that
Kenji was a badass when he was human, but I bet
he wasn't even close to me. Still, if the rumors
are true, he's probably gotten even stronger now
that he's a demonoid. But I'm sure you'll be
fine... as the next King of Tokyo, I guarantee it.
