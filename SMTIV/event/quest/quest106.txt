0: Demons known as [Color:0x5][Demon name 1][Color:0x0] and [Color:0x5][Demon name 2][Color:0x0]
have begun to appear. These may be demons, but
they seem more experienced at fighting than
even us Samurai. We need to take action.
The demons have been seen on the third floor
of Naraku. Only the brave reach true glory!
