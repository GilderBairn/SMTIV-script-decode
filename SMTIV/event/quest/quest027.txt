0: [Color:0x5]Go have a look at the facility beneath the Hills
Building in Roppongi[Color:0x0] and Tayama's shameful secret
will be laid bare. It won't be easy to get to for
all sorts of reasons, but since you passed our
entrance test, I'm sure you'll be fine.

2: Burroughs' note:
That Hikaru girl said that a man named [Color:0x5]Fujiwara
in Shinjuku[Color:0x0] knows a lot about what's beneath
Roppongi. It seems like [Color:0x5]Florida[Color:0x0] is a membersâˆ’
only cafe, but the [Color:0x5]matchbox[Color:0x0] she gave you should
be [Color:0x5]proof of membership...?[Color:0x0]

3: Burroughs' note:
 
According to Mastema, these things called [Color:0x5]Reds[Color:0x0]
are important to what's under Roppongi. Looks like
[Color:0x5]the barrier's gone, so you can move past it.[Color:0x0] I
think we must be getting closer to this facility.
