0: The reason that despair has been with you for
generations is because your creator is an
incompetent. But you seem capable enough, so
I will lend a hand to you. [Color:0x5]Kill the four
White[Color:0x0] who are lurking somewhere within this
forest.
[END]
1: Dummy
[END]
2: To sink into despair is to admit your
powerlessness. But you would never do that,
yes? Well done in killing one of the White.
Only [Color:0x5]three[Color:0x0] are left in this forest now.
Keep showing me your strength...
[END]
3: Don't be taken in by the words of these
”predecessors.” You must stride boldly down
your own path. Well done in killing one of
the White. Only [Color:0x5]two[Color:0x0] are left in this forest
now. Keep showing me your strength...
[END]
4: Hearing those who repress their own will preach
to humans is laughable indeed. Well done in killing
one of the White. Only [Color:0x5]one[Color:0x0] is left in this forest
now. You are almost at your goal.
