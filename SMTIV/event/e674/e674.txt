0: (Demon) [7a 65418][13 1, 418002]Did you know that the great Indian
gods have finally decided to make
more soma?
[->]I need to help them.
[->]I wonder if it would please Shiva if
I danced for them?
[->]Oh, I can't wait!
[END]
1: 〉 The demon is extremely excited...
[END]
2: (Demon) [7a 65418][13 1, 418001]Ah, a truly noble mindset.
Vishnu will be pleased.
[->]My name is Apsaras.
[->](Apsaras) [7a 65418]You see, the gods of India have
decided to come forth and make the
divine wine, Soma.
[->]It's a huge project. They're going
to use the water of Tokyo Bay to do
it.
[->]We're also going to require the skin
from [Color:0x5]Drake Vasuki[Color:0x0]s so that we can
make rope out of it.
[->]I highly doubt that any human would
be able to defeat a Vasuki.
[->]Still, Brahma always says never to
underestimate a human's powers, so
I guess I'll give you a chance.
[->]Once you have collected the Vasuki
skin, please bring it here.
[->]I'm counting on you.
[END]
3: (Apsaras) [7a 65418][13 1, 418000]Vasuki don't show themselves often,
but they're all around on the surface.
[->]So look hard for them, and don't give
up.
[->]I suggest that you don't take them
lightly, or you'll be sorry. They
are extremely scary demons.
[END]
4: (Demon) [7a 65418][13 1, 418001]Ah, a truly noble mindset.
Vishnu will be pleased.

[->]We're also going to require the skin

[->]...What's this? Do you already have
Vasuki skin with you?
[END]
5: (Apsaras) [7a 65418][13 1, 418004]Did you really defeat the Vasuki on
your own!? That's amazing!
[->]We're going to use a good number of
Vasuki skins for the process.
[->]We're always going to need more.
[->]If you happen to collect more Vasuki
skins, please bring them to me.
[END]
6: (Apsaras) [7a 65418][13 1, 418008]Oh, so you get my hopes up, just to
dash them away. What nerve!
[->]I will never forgive you! ...Unless
you bring me some Vasuki skin.
[END]
7: (Apsaras) [7a 65418][13 1, 418003]So? Did you bring the goods?
[END]
8: (Demon) [7a 65418][13 1, 418003]Oh, are you here for the request I
posted, perhaps?
[->]I asked for someone to collect Vasuki
skins. Does that sound familiar?
[END]
9: ”Yes.”
”No.”
[END]
10: (Demon) [7a 65418][13 1, 418004]Oh I'm sorry. My mistake.
[->]I honestly wonder if any human could
slay a Vasuki... This worries me.

900: 〉 There is no one here...
