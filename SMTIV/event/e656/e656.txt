0: 〉 Two Casualries are here.
They appear to be brothers...
[END]
1: (Younger Brother) [7a 35][13 1, 403033]Thank you for deciding to accept our
request, Blessed Samurai.
[->]Our sister is suffering from some
kind of lung ailment.
[->]It is a serious illness, and the
doctor says that he cannot do much
for her.
[->]But the doctor has also told us that
a magical remedy may be found in the
land of the Unclean Ones...
[->]If we can obtain this remedy, there
may be a chance that we can cure
her of her illness.
[END]
2: (Older Brother) [7a 34]......
[END]
3: (Younger Brother) [7a 35][13 1, 403042]I have read a book containing a
description of this remedy.
[->]According to this book, our sister's
illness is already in its final
stage... Things are not looking well.
[->]Please, this is our last hope.
[END]
4: (Older Brother) [7a 34]......
[END]
5: (Younger Brother) [7a 35]Please, would you go into the land
of the Unclean Ones and find this
remedy for our sister?
[END]
6: ”I accept.”
”No.”
[END]
7: (Younger Brother) [7a 35][13 1, 403033]Thank you very much.
[->]The book I read said that there was a
large hospital in a place called
[Color:0x5]Tsukiji.[Color:0x0]
[->]Perhaps you will be able to find the
remedy there. Please, help us save
our sister.
[END]
8: 〉 The brothers leave...
[END]
9: (Older Brother) [7a 34][13 1, 403202]...A moment, please.
[->]May I ask you something?
[->]My brother just asked you to find
that medicine.
[->]...Do you think what you find will
be able to help our sister?
[END]
10: ”I believe so.”
”I have my doubts.”
[END]
11: (Older Brother) [7a 34][13 1, 403203]...I want to believe that, too.
[->]But I read my brother's book... and
the remedy has little effect when the
disease is in its final stage.
[END]
12: (Older Brother) [7a 34][13 1, 403212]...You too, then.
[->]I've read my brother's book... and
the remedy has little effect when the
disease is in its final stage.
[END]
13: (Older Brother) [7a 34][13 1, 403242]My sister is in extremely poor
health. I honestly have little faith
in any medicine's ability to save her.
[->]I think anything we do to help at
this point will only prolong her
suffering.
[->]...So I'd rather let her die
peacefully.
[->]I'm pretty sure my brother has begun
to realize this on his own.
[->]But... He is far too kind to allow
himself to say as much.
[->]......
[->]If you do bring us the remedy, then
I will gladly accept it.
[->]But... If you have the choice, I'd
like you to bring back something
that will let her die in peace.
[->]...Please.
[END]
14: 〉 The older brother leaves...
[END]
15: (Younger Brother) [7a 35][13 1, 403023]...Why?
[->]......
[->]...I understand. I'm sorry. I presume
too much in asking a Samurai to help
us.
[->]If you do ever change you mind,
please help my sister.
[END]
16: 〉 A terrible smell fills the room.
[->]〉 From the things scattered about on
the floor, it would appear that this
room was used to store medication.
[END]
17: 〉 ...The sound of something being eaten
can be heard coming from a corner of
the room.
[->]〉 A silhouette of someone gnawing on
a skull slowly turns in [Flynn]'s
direction...
[END]
18: 〉 The demon's Domain has receded.
The hospital has returned to normal.
[->]〉 Which medication will you take?
[END]
19: The medication for the lung disease
Euthanizing drugs
Take both 
[END]
20: 〉 The brothers have come...
[END]
21: (Younger Brother) [7a 35][13 1, 403042]Were you able to find the remedy,
Blessed Samurai?
[END]
22: 〉 You hand over the medication...
[END]
23: (Younger Brother) [7a 35][13 1, 403033]Thank you very much!
[->]I'm sure this will help our sister
get better!
[END]
24: 〉 The polite brother falls to his
knees and begins to pray with the
medicine in hand...
[END]
25: (Older Brother) [7a 34][13 1, 403242]......
[->]The fact that you brought the cure
means that you want us to take our
chances with this.
[->]Very well. It's not as if I want my
sister to die.
[->]I'm sure she wants to get better
and for us to live as a happy family
again.
[->]I'll pray that she gets better.
Just like my brother.
[END]
26: 〉 The brothers leave...
[END]
27: 〉 You hand the quieter brother the
euthenasia drugs.
[END]
28: (Younger Brother) [7a 35]...!?
[->]That... That's not the remedy, is it?
It can't be...
[END]
29: (Older Brother) [7a 34][13 1, 403242]...It is.
I asked him for it.
[END]
30: (Younger Brother) [7a 35][13 1, 403023]But why...?
[END]
31: (Older Brother) [7a 34][13 1, 403212]...We both know there's no hope.
She's far too weak now, and there's
no way she can possibly recover.
[->]She's been suffering for so long now.
She's... barely even conscious.
[->]You've already realized that,
haven't you?
[->]...It's enough already.
We have to... let her go.
[END]
32: (Younger Brother) [7a 35]......
[END]
33: (Older Brother) [7a 34][13 1, 403242]My apologies, Blessed Samurai.
From here on, this issue is ours
to deal with.
[->]Thank you for the medicine.
[END]
34: 〉 The brothers leave...
[END]
35: 〉 You hand over both the lung
medication and the euthenasia drugs.
[END]
36: (Younger Brother) [7a 35][13 1, 403033]Thank you very much!
[->]I'm sure my sister will...
Wait, what's this?
[END]
37: (Older Brother) [7a 34][13 1, 403242]I asked for it.
[END]
38: (Younger Brother) [7a 35]......!
[->]No, you couldn't!
[END]
39: (Older Brother) [7a 34][13 1, 403212]She's been suffering for so long.
She's... barely even conscious.
[END]
40: (Younger Brother) [7a 35]But this... It's a magical cure!
[END]
41: (Older Brother) [7a 34]......
[->]Blessed Samurai...
[->]The fact that you brought us both
of these means that you want us to
decide for ourselves... right?
[->]I agree. This problem is ours to
handle now.
[->]I've never really spoken my mind
on this before. We will come to a
decision after a long discussion.
[->]Thank you for bringing us these
medicines.
[END]
42: (Younger Brother) [7a 35]I want to take my chances with this
magical remedy. I want us to be a
happy family again!
[END]
43: (Older Brother) [7a 34][13 1, 403212]It's not that...
I don't want to be happy again...
[END]
44: 〉 The brothers leave, glaring at
each other...
[END]
45: 〉 You have obtained lung medication.
[END]
46: 〉 You have obtained euthanasia
drugs.
[END]
47: 〉 The demon's Domain has receded.
The hospital has returned to normal.
[->]〉 You look around, but cannot find
the medicine you are looking for...
[END]
48: (Younger Brother) [7a 35][13 1, 403042]Have you found the remedy yet?
[END]
100: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 1, 502043]I'll register that as a new quest
on the list.
[END]
101: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 1, 502043]I'll register these as new quests
on the list.
[->]It would seem that completing either
of these quests will prevent you from
completing the other.
[->]You should keep that in mind.
[END]
102: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 0, 502044]I have something to tell you.
[->]I have merged the two quests
concerning the medicine into a
single entry.
[->]The quest is now on the list.
[END]
103: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 0, 502044]I'll report the update to the quest.
[->]About the other quest concerning the
medicine...
[->]I will delete it, as it is no longer
necessary on the list.
[END]
120: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 0, 76036]I'm detecting a strong demon ahead.
Do you want to go on?
[END]
121: Yes
No
[END]
900: 〉 There is no one here...
[END]
