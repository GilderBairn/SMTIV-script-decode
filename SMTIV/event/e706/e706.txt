0: 〉 The area around you is slowly being
warped. You sense a foul presence in
the air...
[END]
1: 〉 A very powerful being is about to
tear itself into this dimension.
[END]
2: 〉 Demiurge has disappeared.
The space warping has stopped, and
everything has returned to normal.
[END]
3: (Demon Lord Lucifer) [7a 65056][13 0, 706000]...Well done, [Flynn]. 
[->][13 0, 706001]It would seem that the only child of
man capable of carrying out my
requests is you.
[->][13 0, 706002]Now that you have defeated this demon,
your spiritual powers should have
risen substantially.
[->][13 0, 706003]But that was a mere Godly Spirit,
only pretending to be the Creator.
[->][13 0, 706004]The true enemy that we seek to defeat
will be far superior.
[->][13 0, 706005]Let us go, to regain the true light...
[END]
4: (Demiurge) [7a 0][13 0, 351501]So, you have forced my materializing,
in the hopes of defeating me.
[->][13 0, 351502]Not only that, but you have beguiled
one of my creations and mean to use
him against me.
[->][13 0, 351503]Still relying on your cheap tricks,
Lucifer?
[->][13 0, 351504]Very well. I shall bring the lightning
of punishment down on the symbols of
evil, demons, and mankind.
[END]
5: (Demiurge) [7a 0][13 0, 351505]I shall slay you, just as I have all
the others that strayed from the path
of justice!
[END]
900: 〉 There is no one here...
