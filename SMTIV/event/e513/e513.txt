9: (Mastema) [7a 65520][13 1, 446002]Though it may be temporary, Tayama
brought order to a Tokyo filled with
confusion...
[->]I have decided that this is what the
Lord desires. That is why I overlook
the use of the Reds.
[END]
10: (Mastema) [7a 65520]...Ah, it seems I have said too much.
[END]
11: (Mastema) [7a 65520][13 1, 446004]You wish to go on ahead, correct? I have
already lifted my barrier.
[->]Be careful on your way... my fellow.
[END]
12: (Mastema) [7a 65520][13 1, 446004]You are free to condemn the Reds as
inhumane or defend them as a necessary
evil...
[->]Temporary though it maybe, they bring
order to Tokyo. I have decided that this
is what the Lord wishes.
[END]
13: (Mastema) [7a 65520]My fellow, do not be deluded by the
witch of the night...
[END]
14: (Mastema) [7a 65520][13 1, 446001]...You plan to slay the witch of the
night, correct?
[->]I leave that task to you. I will continue
to supervise the Reds from here.
[END]
15: (Mastema) [7a 65520]Let us both carry out our roles. I wish
you good luck...
[END]
16: (Mastema) [7a 65520][13 1, 446002]...You plan to side with the witch of
the night, correct?
[END]
17: (Mastema) [7a 65520]Turning one's back to the Lord may also
be a chance to learn of His greatness...
[->]In the hopes this will come to pass,
I shall overlook your actions.
[END]
18: (Mastema) [7a 65520][13 1, 446000]No matter what way you choose, I shall
remain here to supervise the Reds.
[->]...Now, go.
[END]
19: (Mastema) [7a 65520][13 1, 446003]Gracious... to think that a son of man
could grow so great as to have the Lord's
chariot at his beck and call.
[END]
20: (Mastema) [7a 65520]If the Lord wishes for the eradication
of the Unclean Ones, you must devote
yourself to carrying out His will.
[END]
21: (Mastema) [7a 65520]I shall continue to supervise the Reds
from here...
[->]Until the very moment you erase Tokyo...
[END]
22: (Mastema) [7a 65520][13 1, 446003]Ah... to think that the son of man,
created by our Lord, would be in league
with the Demon Lord...
[END]
23: (Mastema) [7a 65520]Hoho, be you relieved. I do not
condemn you.
[END]
24: (Mastema) [7a 65520][13 1, 446000]My duty is to supervise the Reds, not to
do battle with demons.
[->]The Lord's chariot will be intervening.
There is no need for me to take an
active hand in the conflict...
[END]
25: (Mastema) [7a 65520][13 1, 446001]...I did not recognize you for a moment.
Your face looks even more intrepid than
before.
[END]
26: (Mastema) [7a 65520]I have heard that you rejected a world
of angels or demons, and chose to return
Tokyo to its previous state.
[->]That is indeed an admirable choice.
Though of course, it means prolonging
the suffering of the sons of man...
[->]What you see as the best way may not
be desirable to all... no?
[END]
27: (Mastema) [7a 65520][13 1, 446004]...'Tis no sin to be troubled. Doubts
are but an opportunity for the seed of
belief in the Lord to germinate.
