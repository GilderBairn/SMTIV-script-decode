4: (Left Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]Halt, young fellow.
[END]
5: (Right Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 404311]To proceed past here is counter to the
Samurai code.
[->]If you consider yourself a Samurai, we
ask that you head back without protest.
[END]
6: (Left Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]Ho there, young fellows.
[->]We heard plainly Abbot Hugo's mandate at
the emergency's meeting...
[END]
7: (Right Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 404311]But we know no other way than the
Samurai code.
[->]That is why we cannot accept Abbot Hugo's
request.
[END]
8: (Left Samurai) [7a 29]Still, were any willing to accept his
quest to appear before us...
[->]We would yield to him graciously.

undertaken Abbot Hugo's quest...
[->]You intend to proceed, correct...?
[END]
10: (Right Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 404311]It would be to the kingdom's detriment
now for us to insist on upholding the
Samurai code...
[->]Yet we know of no other way than to live
by the code. We cannot go with you.
[END]
11: (Left Samurai) [7a 29]At the very least, though, we wish you
good luck as our fellows.

20: The [Color:0x5]StreetPass feature of Shin Megami
Tensei IV[Color:0x0] is now available, allowing you
to use [Color:0x5]DDS[Color:0x0] (Digital Demon Service).
[->]DDS is a special service that allows
demon summoners to connect with one
another.
[->]The demon summoners who use DDS will be
able to exchange [Color:0x5]cards[Color:0x0] to show off [Color:0x5]the
attached demon,[Color:0x0] as well as to strengthen
those demons.
[->]If a demon is attached to a card that's
sent out, the demon may [Color:0x5]gain levels[Color:0x0] or
even come back with an item.
[->]If another user receives the card, the
[Color:0x5]DDS Skill[Color:0x0] that corresponds to the number
of received cards can be used in battle.
[->]To activate StreetPass for Shin Megami
Tensei IV, open the main menu and
select [Color:0x5]Burroughs[Color:0x0] −〉 [Color:0x5]StreetPass.[Color:0x0]
[->]Afterwards, select [Color:0x5]ON/OFF[Color:0x0] to activate or
deactive StreetPass for this game.
[->]In order to exchange data with StreetPass
after activation, you will need to [Color:0x5]push
the wireless switch to enable wireless
communication.[Color:0x0]

22: ”I did.”

23: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 0, 400056]All right. I'll display the
information once more.

25: (Angel) [7a 65463][13 1, 412200]Ah, the warrior of light. How brightly
you shine... I can sense our Lord's
blessing radiating from you.
[->]I am sure that our Lord is eager to see
you will decisively annihilate the
Unclean Ones underground.
[->]Let us defeat the demons in order to
bring peace to the sons of man chosen
by the Lord.
[END]
26: (Angel) [7a 65463][13 1, 412209]Son of man who denies our Lord's
salvation in favor of a path filled
with thorns...
[->]There can be no peace without the Lord's
blessing. For the creator of the world
is...

We shall wait until the day that the
sons of man require us again...
[END]
27: (Angel) [7a 65463][13 1, 412203]You who denied the temptation of demons
and chose to remain a son of man...
[->]Just as the demons have departed for the
present, so shall we... But the time of
our reunion will not be long in coming.
[->]For the sons of man have been fertile
ground for demons since days of old.
That is why we exist...

28: (Demon) [7a 65049][13 1, 411106]I intended on being the first to go into
the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado, but I'm

use now. And even if I could go ahead...

wings off those bastards!

29: (Demon) [7a 65049][13 1, 411106]I intended on being the first to go into

[->]Though it feels like things have changed
a bit up ahead... But nah, I won't be
suckered.

you into a false sense of security...
and then beating the daylights outta you.
