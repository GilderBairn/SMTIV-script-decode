0: 〉 A demon stands at the back of the
room...
[END]
1: (Demon) [7a 65049][13 1, 411104]Heh heh heh... I love this world.
All this chaos... It's great.
[->][13 1, 411105]Huh? Who the hell are you, human?
I'm in a good mood right now, so
you'd better not ruin it for me.
[->]Go be a good boy, turn around, and
get outta here before I, the great
Loki, tear you a new asshole.
[END]
2: ”I have come to slay you.”
”I'll be going now.”
[END]
3: (Loki) [7a 65049][13 1, 411109]...I see how it is. Those damn Aesirs
put you up to this, huh?
[->]Heimdall, you bastard...
That persistence of his is really
getting on my nerves.
[->]Heh heh heh... But, this wasn't a
smart move. It looks like he wants to
see what I'm really capable of.
[->]And here I was, thinking that I might
just take it easy for the next century
or so...
[->]Whatever. If he wants a war, he's
gonna get a war.
[->]Fine. Let's see what you've got,
mister mercenary!
[END]
4: (Loki) [7a 65049][13 1, 411103]Heh heh... Smart choice, kid.
Keep it up, and you'll live longer.
[->]Well, hurry up and get out.
Here, I'll walk you to the exit.
[END]
5: (Loki) [7a 65049][13 1, 411107]You again? If you don't have anything
to do here, get the hell out.
[->]Now be a good boy and toddle along...
Before the great Loki gets angry.
[END]
6: (Loki) [7a 65049][13 1, 411107]What the hell? I, the great Loki,
was defeated by a human?
[->]Well, so much for having a war.
[->]That was pretty fun, though. Who'd
have thought that this place would
hold such surprises for me?
[->]Heh heh... This is why I could never
quit being a god.

901: (Demon) [7a 65049][13 1, 411104]Heh heh heh... I love this world.
All this chaos... It's great.
