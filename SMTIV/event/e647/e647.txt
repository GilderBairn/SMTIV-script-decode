0: 〉 There is a demon standing at the
back of the room...
[END]
1: (Demon) [7a 65355][13 1, 411200]There you are, human. So, you're
my next challenger, huh?
[->]Looks like that Hunter is keeping
his promise to me.
[->]My name is Take−Mikazuchi.
[->](Take−Mikazuchi) [7a 65355]I was summoned to this country in
order to save it while it was losing
a war about a hundred years ago.
[->]But the other nation had stronger
spirits on their side. I was severely
injured, and the country lost the war...
[->]Ever since then, I've been hanging
out around here. It's rather dull.
[->]This land lacks a Summoner.
[->][13 1, 411201]And today, you've come to challenge
me...
[->]So I suppose the Hunter I asked must
think highly of you.
[->]All right, that's enough chit−chat.
Are you ready to fight?
[END]
2: ”Yes.”
”No.”
[END]
3: (Take−Mikazuchi) [7a 65355][13 1, 411204]Good answer!
[->]That Hunter met my expectations
better than I could have hoped!
He's brought me a good opponent.
[->]Let's fight!
[END]
4: (Take−Mikazuchi) [7a 65355][13 1, 411211]Well, that just killed the mood.
[->]But, if you don't want to face off
against a god of war, I certainly
can't blame you.
[->]Come back when you feel like fighting
me.
[END]
5: (Take−Mikazuchi) [7a 65355][13 1, 411200]Oh, it's you.
[->]Well, since you're back here, I take
it you want to fight?
[END]
6: (Take−Mikazuchi) [7a 65355][13 1, 411201]Pretty good, human. To think I,
Take−Mikazuchi, would be defeated
by you.
[->]I've decided to leave this place...
[->]It's been pretty hard, you know,
looking for someone stronger than me.
[->]Well, I'll be going now.
[->]...Now that I think about it, there
were other demons summoned here years
ago, as well.
[->]I wonder if they're still trying to
protect this country...
[END]
7: 〉 The demon disappears...
[END]
900: 〉 There is nobody here...
