Ikebukuro? Is today trash day? Oh well.

place...

to bother you...!

3: (Demonoid) [7a 148][13 1, 417104]Huh? A neurisher? What, you want us to
adopt you?
[->]Sorry, we only feed on adults. Could you
come back when you've grown up a little?
[END]
4: (Demonoid) [7a 148][13 1, 417101]Oh, Akira... sorry, Master Akira's
bodyguard? You're a handsome one up
close.

entrance fee. Have fun in Ikebukuro.
