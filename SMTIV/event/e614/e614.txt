0: 〉 A suspicious−looking man stands
in a deserted area...
[END]
1: Follow him
Leave him alone
[END]
2: 〉 The suspicious man looks in your
direction...
[->]〉 It appears that he has noticed you.
[END]
3: (Suspicious Man) [7a 35][13 0, 614000]I can tell you're following me.
From the look of you, I'm guessing
you're one of those... Samurai?
[->][13 0, 614001]Bah... It doesn't matter who you are.
I'm sure you have a problem with
this country too, right?
[->][13 0, 614002]Don't you think that this whole
class system is ridiculous?
[END]
4: ”Yes, it is.”
”Society needs rules.”
[END]
5: (Suspicious Man) [7a 35][13 0, 614003]Then here's what we need to do:
start a revolution. We have to risk
our lives to fight for freedom.
[->][13 0, 614004]But you must be prepared to lay down
your life for the cause, understand?
So... you first.
[END]
6: (Suspicious Man) [7a 35][13 0, 614005]Yeah, that's what I thought a Samurai
would say. You can take those ”rules”
and shove 'em up your ass.
[->][13 0, 614006]Nobody understands how this society
oppresses us. Something must be done
to wake the people up.
[END]
7: (Demon) [7a 64918][13 0, 614007]Did I surprise you? This is what it
means to be truly awakened...
[->][13 0, 614008]With this power, I'm going to end
this tyranny forever!
[END]
8: 〉 [Flynn] decides to leave without
following the man.
[END]
9: (Master Samurai) [7a 29][13 0, 614009]Hm? [Flynn], is that you over
there? Ah, I see... You've slain the
demon.
[->][13 0, 614010]I expected as much from the star
prentice. You even beat me to it...
Impressive!
[->][13 0, 614011]I have high hopes for you.
Keep up the good work.
[END]
10: 〉 The man puts on a mask and raises
his spear high into the air.

11: 〉 The demon has vanished.
