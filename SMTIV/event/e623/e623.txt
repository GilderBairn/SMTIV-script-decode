0: (Nozomi) [7a 0][13 0, 623000]Oh, hey, you're that guy from before!
So you accepted my quest, huh?
[->][13 0, 623001]...You're the famous [Flynn], right?
I've heard a lot of rumors about you.
[->][13 0, 623002]Well, I'd like to formally request
your aid in slaying a demon.
[->][13 0, 623003]The place is further north of the
Ueno district...
[->][13 0, 623004]The demon Asura is attacking people
over there.
[->][13 0, 623005]He's become a real threat, so I've
been asked to put him down. I'm
trying to recruit people to help me.
[->][13 0, 623006]And, actually, you're the only one
to show up... But I'm pretty sure
the two of us can beat him.
[->][13 0, 623007]Well, let's get going.
I'm counting on you.
[END]
1: 〉 Nozomi has joined you.
[END]
2: (Nozomi) [7a 0][13 0, 623008]*whistle* So that's what the famous
Hunter can do. You must be pretty
strong if you can defeat Asura.
[->][13 0, 623009]I'm pretty sure if I'd fought
him alone, he would've eaten me...
I really appreciate your help.
[->][13 0, 623010]If something else comes up, I'll
make sure to call you. Here's your
reward. Take it with my thanks.
[END]
3: 〉 Nozomi leaves...
[->]〉 You and Nozomi have parted ways.
[END]
4: (Nozomi) [7a 0][13 1, 402102]Hm. I guess we kinda underestimated
that demon, huh?
[->]Well, let's get going again.
I'm counting on you.
[END]
5: (Nozomi) [7a 0][13 1, 402101]The place we're looking for is north
of the Ueno district, along the
Arakawa River.
[->]Well, let's get going.
I'm counting on you.
[END]
6: (Nozomi) [7a 0][13 0, 623011]Oh, yeah, if we see each other again,
you've got to show me some of the
pictures you've taken! See ya 'round!
[END]
900: The female Hunter Nozomi
joins as a guest. A marker for
the Fury Asura will be placed.
[END]
901: 〉 Nobody's here...
[END]
902: You have defeated the Fury Asura.
The quest will end after this event.
Nozmoi will leave your party.
[END]
903: 〉 Nozmoi has returned to where you
found her to recover from her wounds.
[END]
