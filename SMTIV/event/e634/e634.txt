0: (Okuninushi) [7a 65129][13 1, 412105]I am the Kunitsukami Okuninushi.
This is no place for humans such as
yourself.
[->]If you are not here to cause trouble,
then I shall permit you to leave
unharmed. Now, leave this place.
[END]
1: ”I am here to slay you.”
Leave
[END]
2: (Okuninushi) [7a 65129][13 1, 412102]That is for the best. Do not allow
yourself to be swayed by wicked
thoughts.
[END]
3: (Okuninushi) [7a 65129][13 1, 412100]Oho... So, you see me as an evil
being who slays humans, and have
come to dispose of me.
[->]I only attack humans to punish them
for foolish behavior. You may think
of this as a sort of curse.
[->]It was by your own selfishness that
the Field of Autumn Leaves was
destroyed.
[->]And now, you reach out with your
filthy hands to try to take the
Kanda Shrine...
[->]All humans here are guilty of the
same crime.
[->]I shall bring you divine punishment,
right here and now.
[END]
4: (Client Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403001]Hey, [Flynn]. Were you the one
who got rid of the demon?
[->]Huh? The demon was pissed about us
ruining... Akihabara?
[->]That was the Ashura−kai's fault.
We had nothing to do with it.
[->]Well, even if that demon had a reason
to attack us, that doesn't mean we
have to take it lying down.
[->]Anyway, good job. Here's your reward.
[END]
100: (Okuninushi) [7a 65129][13 1, 412109]What is the matter?
[->]I did say that I would let you go
without incident, as long as you
mean me no harm.
[->]Now, go away, at once.
[END]
900: 〉 There is no one here...
[END]
901: Okuninushi will attack you.
[END]
902: The Hunter that commissioned the
quest will thank you, and the quest
will be complete.
[END]
