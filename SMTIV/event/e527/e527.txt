0: (Cheerful demonoid) [7a 146][13 1, 415105]...Huh? Didn't think I'd run into a
neurisher here. That's something you
don't see every day.
[->]I could use someone to talk to. I won't
snack on you, so come and talk to me.
[END]
1: ”Very well.”
”I think not.”
[END]
2: (Cheerful demonoid) [7a 146][13 1, 415101]...Thanks.
[END]
3: (Cheerful demonoid) [7a 146][13 1, 415108]Huh... Hey, don't worry about it. I can
just hang around here a while longer.
[END]
4: (Cheerful demonoid) [7a 146]You see that giant cocoon behind me?
[END]
5: (Cheerful demonoid) [7a 146]It's hard to picture it now, but a long
time ago, Shinjuku was the angels' turf.
[->]They kidnapped a bunch of kids and locked
'em up in that cocoon.
[->]They said they were going to take them
to a ”new millennium.”
[END]
6: (Cheerful demonoid) [7a 146]In the end, Kenji−−who was a human at
the time−−and his crowd killed them all.
[->]Since then, the cocoon hasn't been
touched... They let out the kids who
were inside, of course.
[END]
7: (Cheerful demonoid) [7a 146]I thought I'd forget about it when I gave
up being human, but maybe my sharp new
sense of smell reminds me a lot...
[->]The smell of my rotting daughter, with
the flies buzzing around her, coming
from that cocoon...
