2: (Isabeau) [7a 5][7b 65541, 196609][13 0, 254003]It's just as Walter said...
[END]
3: (Isabeau) [7a 5][7b 655365, 65537][13 0, 254004]You intend to annihilate Tokyo through
the use of the Yamato Reactor, no?
[END]
4: (Isabeau) [7a 5][7b 131077, 65537][13 0, 254005]It may be for the sake of the people of
the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado... but it
is tantamount to genocide.

5: (Isabeau) [7a 5][7b 655365, 131073][7b 196613, 65537][13 0, 254007]...You, [Flynn], are a strong Samurai
who can be proud of the path you've
chosen...
[END]
6: (Isabeau) [7a 5][7b 655365, 65537][13 0, 254009]Nevertheless... I abhor the idea of
you doing something so horrible as
annihilating Tokyo!

104: (Merkabah) [7a 205][7b 65741, 65537][13 0, 254006]This woman has come in contact with
Tokyo's manga. She is Unclean and would
lead we righteous ones astray.
[END]
105: (Isabeau) [7a 5][7b 327685, 65537][13 0, 254008]But I... I could not make my decision
until the very end.
[END]
109: (Merkabah) [7a 64478][13 0, 254012]If Tokyo is left untouched, there will
be many more victims like her.
