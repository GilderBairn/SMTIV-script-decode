201: 〉 [Flynn] arrives in the days of
yore, in the Eastern Kingdom of
Mikado...
[END]
202: (Suspicious voice) [7a 1]...I was expecting your arrival.
[END]
203: (Hooded man) [7a 31]Welcome to our era... This is the
Eastern Kingdom of Mikado, many
years before your time.
[->]You may call me ”M.” I was the one
who asked for your help.
[END]
204: (M) [7a 31]My sole purpose in life is to
faithfully serve the Lord's will,
and to make His visions a reality.

205: (M) [7a 31]...That is why I must ask you to
defeat [Color:0x5]Uriel[Color:0x0] and [Color:0x5]Raphael.[Color:0x0]
[END]
206: (M) [7a 31]You see... They have forsaken the
will of the Lord.
[->]The Angels were originally meant to
aid in the establishment of the Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado, and then observe.
[->]Humans were supposed to be left to
their own devices in this land...
That was the Lord's will.
[->]However, the Four Archangels have
turned their backs on the Lord's will,
and are meddling in human affairs.
[->]Under the auspices of disposing of
the demons in Tokyo, they seek to
wipe out the humans living there, too.
[END]
207: (M) [7a 31]They have gone too far... I am sure
that the Lord must be deeply saddened
by these events.
[->]That is why I, with the help of the
now−late Aquila, have been working
on a certain plan...
[->]...One that will help us truly become
one with the Lord's will.
[END]
208: (M) [7a 31]Uriel and Raphael have headed to
Tokyo in order to reconnoiter.
[->]I'm afraid they are up to no good.
[->]We must rid ourselves of these rats
who have snuck into the world below
the ground.
[->]Are you ready for this task?
[END]
209: ”I am prepared.”
”Not now.”
[END]
210: (M) [7a 31][13 1, 446004]Very good. Let us proceed, then.

[END]
215: 〉 A fierce lightning storm begins
to rage in the air nearby...
[END]
216: (Uriel) [7a 65517]Art thou not a citizen of the
Eastern Kingdom of Mikado? Why art
thou here, in the land of the Unclean?
[->]Ah... This was all his doing, was
it not?
[END]
217: (Uriel) [7a 91]And now he hath replaced Aquila
with thee...
[END]
218: (Uriel) [7a 91]...Thou shalt not interfere with our
plans.
[END]
219: (M) [7a 31]Ah, is that so...? Very well, I shall
return you to your original era.
[END]
301: (M) [7a 31]You have gotten rid of Uriel...
[END]
302: (M) [7a 31]Aha... And the other rat has noticed
our involvement.
[END]
303: (Prominent voice) [7a 1]How foolish of thee...
[END]
304: 〉 A violent windstorm begins to blow...
[END]
305: (Raphael) [7a 65521]If thou wouldst defy us, the Four
Archangels, then we shall have no mercy for
thee, even if the Lord chooseth you.
[END]
306: (Raphael) [7a 90]Let me tell thee what the Unclean
Ones refer to us as...
[END]
307: (Raphael) [7a 90]The demons of the land...
The Angels of Death!
[END]
401: (M) [7a 31][13 1, 446010]Oh glory, glory hallelujah...
Ah, how marvelous.
[->]Both Uriel and Raphael have fallen.
[->]It would seem that my choice of allies
was no mistake.
[->]Had the situation been reversed, I
would have been the one whose wings
were plucked off.
[END]
402: (M) [7a 31]Now then, what should I do with you,
Uriel and Raphael?
[END]
403: (M) [7a 31][13 1, 446000]Ah ha, yes, I know...
I will make you into ”nobody.”
[->]Yes, that will be perfect...!
[END]
404: (M) [7a 31]I will send you back to your original
era.

time.

Do you know who this is?
[->]This is what has become of the
Archangels you have defeated.
[END]
503: (Masked Man) [7a 28][13 1, 402701]Please, remove this mask... I cannot
even remember who I am anymore...
[END]
504: (M) [7a 31]You have no need to remember.
You are nobody now.
[->]Into your cage!
[END]
505: 〉 The masked man is locked away within
the bird cage...
[END]
506: (M) [7a 31]...Finally, Kagome's Seal has been
completed.

fulfilled...

[END]
511: (Mastema) [7a 65520]This is [Color:0x5]Tyrant Aeshma...[Color:0x0]
He was a keepsake of Aquila's.
From now on, let him be yours.
[END]

[Color:0x5]Tyrant Aeshma[Color:0x0] has been lifted.

era.
[->]I shall now rebuild Tokyo into a
world that follows the Lord's will.

humans−−rule.
[->]I look forward to the day we meet
again.
[END]
1001: (M) [7a 31]It pleases me to be able to meet
you again.
[->]...If you don't mind, I'd like to
get straight to business.
[END]
1002: (M) [7a 31]It pleases me to be able to meet
you again.
[->]Would you like to hear the details of
my request once more?
[END]
1003: ”Yes.”
”No.”
[END]
1004: (M) [7a 31]Very well, then...
[END]
