201: 〉 [Flynn] arrives in the bygone days
of the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado...
[END]
202: (Suspicious voice) [7a 1]...I was expecting your arrival.
[END]
203: (Hooded man) [7a 31]Welcome to our era... This is the
Eastern Kingdom of Mikado, many
years before your time.
[->]You may call me ”M.” I was the one
who asked for your help.
[END]
204: (M) [7a 31]My sole purpose in life is to
faithfully serve the Lord's will,
and to make His visions a reality.
[END]
205: (M) [7a 31]...That is why I must ask you to
defeat [Color:0x5]Gabriel[Color:0x0] and [Color:0x5]Michael.[Color:0x0]
[END]
206: (M) [7a 31]You see... They have forsaken the
will of the Lord.
[->]The Angels were originally meant to
aid in the establishment of the Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado, and then observe.
[->]Humans were supposed to be left to
their own devices in this land...
That was the Lord's will.
[->]However, the Four Archangels have
turned their backs on the Lord's will,
and are meddling in human affairs.
[->]Under the auspices of disposing of
the demons in Tokyo, they seek to
wipe out the humans living there, too.
[END]
207: (M) [7a 31]They have gone too far... I am sure
that the Lord must be deeply saddened
by these events.
[->]That is why I, with the help of the
now−late Aquila, have been working
on a certain plan...
[->]...One that will help us truly become
one with the Lord's will.
[END]
208: (M) [7a 31]Gabriel and Michael are currently
in the holy land of Shene Duque.
[->]I'm afraid they are up to no good.
[->]We must rid ourselves of these rats
who have made their nests in the
holy land.
[->]Are you ready for this task?
[END]
209: ”I am prepared.”
”Not now.”
[END]
210: (M) [7a 31][13 1, 446004]Very good. Let us proceed, then.
[END]
211: 〉 [Flynn] and M arrive at
Shene Duque...
[END]
212: (M) [7a 31]Observe this enormous cocoon. That is
the holy vessel... A place humans are
forbidden to enter.
[END]
213: 〉 [Flynn] follows M into the
giant cocoon...
[END]
214: (Elegant voice) [7a 1]...I was expecting thee.
[END]
215: 〉 A freezing chill begins to spread
in the air nearby...
[END]
216: (Gabriel) [7a 65523]...Nothing more need be said.
[->]Thou hast come for us, as another
messenger of that crow, yes?
[END]
217: (Gabriel) [7a 88]How lamentable.
[->]The human falls so easily to the
temptations of the demons, just as
Aquila did.
[END]
218: (Gabriel) [7a 88]I, Gabriel, shall purify thy heart of
the Filth that gnaweth at it..
[END]
219: (M) [7a 31]Ah, is that so...? Very well, I shall
return you to your original era.
[END]
252: (M) [7a 31]I, however, do have the authority
to go inside.
[->]...Come, let us go.
[END]
301: (Michael) [7a 89]I, Michael, leader of the Four
Archangels, shall be thine opponent
now.
[END]
302: (Michael) [7a 89]Thou shalt be shown the very image
of Hell...
[->]...The same that was seen by the
demons as they fell from grace.
[END]
401: (Gabriel) [7a 88]Impossible...
Even our leader, Michael...
[END]
402: 〉 Will you kill Gabriel?
[END]
403: Yes
No
[END]
404: 〉 [Flynn] draws his sword and
approaches Gabriel...
[END]
405: (M) [7a 31]A moment, if you will.
Please, sheathe your sword...
[->]I have an idea.
[END]
406: (M) [7a 31]Ha ha... Great minds do think alike.
I was thinking something similar.
[END]
407: (M) [7a 31]...Let us let this rat go free.
[->]There is no cause for alarm here.
One rat can do no harm on its own.
[END]
408: (Gabriel) [7a 88]Curses...
[->]...You will pay for this. I will see
to it, no matter how long it takes.
[->]We will meet again, [Flynn]...
[END]
409: 〉 Gabriel flies away...
[END]
410: Unused
[END]
411: (M) [7a 31][13 1, 446010]Oh glory, glory hallelujah...
Ah, how marvelous.
[->]Both Gabriel and Michael have fallen.
[->]...Well, we did allow one of the rats
to escape.
[->]It would seem that my choice of allies
was no mistake. This was truly the
will of the Lord.
[END]
412: (M) [7a 31]Now then, what should I do with you,
Michael?
[END]
413: (M) [7a 31][13 1, 446000]Ah ha, yes, I know...
I will make you into ”nobody”...
[->]Yes, that will be perfect...!
[END]
414: (M) [7a 31]I will send you back to your original
era.
[->]...I may ask for your help another
time.
[END]
500: 〉 M has brought [Flynn] to a
strange place...
[->]〉 A naked man with a mask over his
head is sitting next to M.
[END]
501: 〉 M's power has brought [Flynn] to a
strange place...
[->]〉 A naked man with a mask over his
head is sitting next to M.
[END]
502: (M) [7a 31][13 1, 446000]Ha ha...
Do you know who this is?
[->]This is what has become of the
Archangels you have defeated.
[END]
503: (Masked Man) [7a 28][13 1, 402701]Please, remove this mask... I cannot
even remember who I am anymore...
[END]
504: (M) [7a 31]You have no need to remember.
You are nobody now.
[->]Into your cage!
[END]
505: 〉 The masked man is locked away within
the bird cage...
[END]
506: (M) [7a 31]...Finally, Kagome's Seal has been
completed.
[->]My promise to Aquila can finally be
fulfilled...
[END]
507: 〉 M tears away his robe...
[END]
508: (Mastema) [7a 65520]I am the Herald Mastema.
I thank you for your help.
[->]...Accept this gift from me.
It is a sign of my gratitude.
[END]
509: 〉 Mastema holds his hand over
[Flynn]'s Gauntlet...
[END]
510: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 1, 400003]Master [Flynn],
I have received new demon info.
[END]
511: (Mastema) [7a 65520]This is [Color:0x5]Tyrant Aeshma...[Color:0x0]
He was a keepsake of Aquila's.
From now on, let him be yours.
[END]
512: 〉 The restriction on fusing
[Color:0x5]Tyrant Aeshma[Color:0x0] has been lifted.
[END]
513: (Mastema) [7a 65520]I will send you back to your original
era.
[->]I shall now rebuild Tokyo into a
world that follows the Lord's will.
[->]The world where the Unclean Ones−−no,
humans−−rule.
[->]I look forward to the day we meet
again.
[END]
1001: (M) [7a 31]It pleases me to be able to meet
you again.
[->]...If you don't mind, I'd like to
get straight to business.
[END]
1002: (M) [7a 31]It pleases me to be able to meet
you again.
[->]Would you like to hear the details of
my request once more?
[END]
1003: ”Yes.”
”No.”
[END]
1004: (M) [7a 31]Very well, then...
[END]
1005: (M) [7a 31]Then let us get straight to business...
[END]
1401: (M) [7a 31]We have brought down all four of the
Archangels.
[->]I am sure Gabriel has fled to the
Lord's side to desperately plead for
forgiveness.
[END]
1402: (M) [7a 31]Now, let us deal with the aftermath.
[->]If you would accompany me to Tokyo...
[END]

his original era...
[END]
2001: 〉 Mastema's powers return [Flynn]
to his original era...

like to start at?
[END]

The battle with Gabriel
