201: (Voice) [7a 1][13 1, 401001]...Hello. Thank you for coming.
[END]
202: (Stephen) [7a 14]This is the Expanse...
a place that transcends past, present,
and future.
[END]
203: (Stephen) [7a 14]I will now guide you to a ”certain
past.”
[->]It is a day that holds a very
significant moment in our
history...
[->]And, it is a day that ”you of the
present” must one day see.
[END]
204: (Stephen) [7a 14]Now then, let us go.
[->]To the day that the sky closed over
Tokyo...
[END]
301: (Stephen) [7a 1]...We're here.
[END]
302: (Stephen) [7a 14]We are in the Tokyo you know, before
your own time.
[END]
303: (Stephen) [7a 14]...There isn't much time left to
explain, so I shall be brief.
[->]Look up in the sky.
[END]
304: (Stephen) [7a 1]Do you see that light?
[->]...That is an intercontinental
ballistic missile.
[END]
305: (Stephen) [7a 1]It all started with the Yamato Perpetual
Reactor. 
[->]Once it made a connection to the
Expanse, demons began to flow into
this world.
[->]So began the war for control between
the angels and the demons, eventually
leading to a world war among humanity.
[END]
306: (Stephen) [7a 1]...And now, a certain country has
just launched some of the worst weapons
known to man.
[->]Unfortunately... One of them is heading
directly towards Tokyo.
[->]Soon, it will destroy this city...
[END]
307: (Stephen) [7a 1]...But, turn around.
[END]
308: 〉 A giant demon fills your sight...
[END]
309: (Stephen) [7a 1]That enormous god is the guardian of
Tokyo, Masakado.
[->]He is trying to cover the entire city
of Tokyo with his body in order to
protect it from the missile.
[END]
310: (Stephen) [7a 1]However, he has lost control of himself,
just as the people of Tokyo have lost
themselves...
[->]If the missile reaches Tokyo, any
future the city may have had will
dissolve into mere possibility.
[END]
311: (Stephen) [7a 14]I believe you can bring Masakado back
to himself.
[->]If you were to challenge him, I am
sure he will respond.
[->]Are you willing to fight Masakado?
[END]
312: Fight Masakado
Don't fight Masakado
[END]
313: (Stephen) [7a 14]...I see.
[->]Then you must hurry. There is no time.
[END]
314: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 1, 400003]I will let you know how long we have
before the missile impacts.
[->]You just concentrate on the fight,
Master [Flynn].
[END]
315: (Stephen) [7a 14][13 1, 401001]Hello, Burroughs. I see you've been
improved while I was away.
[END]
316: (Burroughs) [7a 2]It has been quite some time, Doctor.
[END]
317: (Stephen) [7a 14]I wish I had the time to chat with you
more, but we do not have that luxury.
[END]
318: (Burroughs) [7a 2]Goodbye, Doctor. We'll talk later.
[END]
319: (Burroughs) [7a 2]Master [Flynn], hurry.
The estimated time of missile impact
is fast approaching.
[END]
320: 〉 [Flynn] runs towards Masakado...
[END]
321: (Stephen) [7a 14]...I see. So that is your choice.
[END]
322: 〉 An intense light swallows all of
Tokyo...
[END]
400: 〉 Masakado has changed himself into a
barrier enveloping all of Tokyo.
[END]
401: (Stephen) [7a 14]And so, Tokyo will follow the path of
history that you and I are familiar
with.
[->]A history where the Eastern Kingdom of
Mikado is founded on Masakado's back,
and where you will one day be born.
[END]
402: 〉 You hear the voice of Masakado
echoing around you...
[END]
403: (Masakado) [7a 1]Tokyo has been protected...
However, good and evil still remain.
[->]The souls of humanity will be tortured
by the hardships to come, due to the
neverending battle of law and chaos.
[->]However, you have left them with the
greatest of all gifts: hope.
[->]As long as there is hope, the Goddess
will never die.
[END]
404: (Masakado) [7a 1][Flynn]...
I shall grant you my ”shadow.”
[->]Use it as your shield in battle.
[END]
405: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 1, 400005]...Oh? I'm receiving some kind of
data.
[END]
406: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 1, 400003]Master [Flynn], I've received some
demon information.
[END]
407: 〉 The restriction on fusing [Color:0x5]Fury
Maskado's Shadow[Color:0x0] has been lifted.
[END]
408: Unused
[END]
409: Unused
[END]
410: (Stephen) [7a 14][13 1, 401001]So, did you have enough time to talk?
[END]
411: (Stephen) [7a 14]...Now then, let me get you back to
when you belong.
[->]Thank you... both of you.
[END]
451: (Stephen) [7a 14]It seems your power wasn't enough
this time.
[->]You can try again, if you wish to.
”Tokyo” still needs your help, after
all...
[END]
452: (Stephen) [7a 14]...Well then, let me return you to
your original era.
[END]
2000: 〉 With Stephen's help, [Flynn]
returns to his own time...
[END]
2100: 〉 Where would you like to start the
quest?
[END]
2101: From the beginning
From the battle with Masakado
[END]
