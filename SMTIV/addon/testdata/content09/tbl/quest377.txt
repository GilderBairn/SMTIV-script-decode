0: I am a wayfarer of space and time. My latest hobby is
to hire dwarves to craft various items and give them
to people of various timelines. I have an outfit made
in the image of the [Color:0x5]bringer of light;[Color:0x0] it is my finest
work, hewn from a superdimensional fabric similar to
light itself. I'd trade it for  [Color:0x5][Item 1][Color:0x0] x[Color:0x5][Amount 1],[Color:0x0]
deliverable to a [Color:0x5]Hunter Association[Color:0x0] or [Color:0x5]K's Tavern.[Color:0x0]
