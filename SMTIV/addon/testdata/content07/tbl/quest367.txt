0: I am a wayfarer of space and time. My latest hobby is
to hire dwarves to craft various items and give them
to people of various timelines. This time, I had them
make something of hardened [Color:0x5]demon scales.[Color:0x0] If you want
it, I'll trade for [Color:0x5][Item 1][Color:0x0] x[Color:0x5][Amount 1].[Color:0x0] Just deliver
it to a [Color:0x5]Hunter Association[Color:0x0] or [Color:0x5]K's Tavern,[Color:0x0] whichever
suits you best.
