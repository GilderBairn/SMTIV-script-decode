0: I am a wayfarer of space and time. My latest hobby is
to hire dwarves to craft various items and give them
to people of various timelines. I have replicated the
[Color:0x5]clothing worn by commanders[Color:0x0] of the Eastern Kingdom of
Mikado. If you would like some, I would be willing
to trade it for [Color:0x5][Item 1][Color:0x0] x[Color:0x5][Amount 1].[Color:0x0] Deliver them to a
[Color:0x5]Hunter Association[Color:0x0] or [Color:0x5]K's Tavern,[Color:0x0] whichever suits you.
