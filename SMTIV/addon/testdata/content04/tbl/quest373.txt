to hire dwarves to craft various items and give them
to people of various timelines. This time, I would like

this aura [Color:0x5]turns one's hair blond.[Color:0x0] I'll give it to you
for [Color:0x5][Item 1][Color:0x0] x[Color:0x5][Amount 1].[Color:0x0] Deliver them to a [Color:0x5]Hunter
Association[Color:0x0] or [Color:0x5]K's Tavern,[Color:0x0] whichever suits you.
