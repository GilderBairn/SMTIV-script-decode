0: I am a wayfarer of space and time. My latest hobby is
to hire dwarves to craft various items and give them
to people of various timelines. For a change of pace,
I had them put their skill at intricate metalwork to
use in crafting a [Color:0x5]pair of glasses.[Color:0x0] If you would like
them, deliver [Color:0x5][Item 1][Color:0x0] x[Color:0x5][Amount 1][Color:0x0] to a [Color:0x5]Hunter
Association[Color:0x0] or [Color:0x5]K's Tavern,[Color:0x0] whichever suits you.
