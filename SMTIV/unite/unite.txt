24: (Mido) [7a 0]Demon fusion is a process in which
multiple demons are fused to create
a new one.
[->]Pay no mind to the demons' place of
origin, divinity, or tradition; fuse
whatever demons you like together.
[->]This is a process which fears no god...
For that reason, it might be said to be
immoral and taboo.

types of demons... Remember them well.
[->][END]
26: (Mido) [7a 0]The [Color:0x5]fusion limit[Color:0x0] is the level restraint
on demons that can be created through
fusion.
[->]There is a fear that demons of too high
a level would be too powerful for you
to safely control.
[->]That is why you cannot create demons with
levels higher than the fusion limit.
[->]The fusion limit is connected to your
own level.

you must first increase your own level.

27: (Mido) [7a 0]Apart from a select few, the skills your
component demons know can be passed down

that list.
[->][END]
34: (Mido) [7a 0]After choosing the resulting demon,
select a combination of component
demons for the fusion.
[->]This step is necessary since most demons
can be fused via multiple combinations.
[->]When choosing component demons, look to
their [Color:0x5]skills[Color:0x0] and the [Color:0x5]demons currently
at your side.[Color:0x0]
[->]The skills inherited from the component
demons and the makeup of your party after
the fusion are both important factors.
[->]Keep these thoughts in mind as you
select your component demons.
[->][END]
35: (Mido) [7a 0]Once you have a resulting demon and its
component demons, the final step is to
choose skills to pass down.

choice into the resulting demon's
skill slots.
[->]When you have made your decisions,
press [button 196608] to move on.

36: (Mido) [7a 0]After the final step has been taken,
you may review the resulting demon's
details.

your new demon's stats, affinities,
and skills.
[->]All that remains is to press [button 0] to
commit to the fusion.

37: (Mido) [7a 0]You may specify demons you are adamant
about using as a component in the fusion.

as components in order to create even
more powerful allies...

usefulness to you and you wish to wring
one final use from it...
[->]There are good reasons why you may wish
to set this condition.

38: (Mido) [7a 0]You may specify demons as off limits from
being used as a component in the fusion.

registered with Analyze can be specified.
[->]It can be useful if you know you will
need a demon of a specific race for
a later fusion.
[->][END]
42: (Mido) [7a 0]This allows you to specify an individual
demon to create.
[->]However, you cannot specify a demon which
you've never encountered before.

a particular role, such as strking enemy
weaknesses, or support and healing...
[->]You may find this condition useful.
[->][END]
44: (Mido) [7a 0]You can specify individual skills you
wish the resulting demon to have.
[->]However, you cannot specify a skill which
you have never seen put to use before.
[->]If your own party has used it, or it has
been used against you, that is another
matter.
[->]This is a helpful condition if you
wish to build your demons in a very
specific way.
[->][END]
45: (Mido) [7a 0]You can specify elements that you require
the resulting demons to be resistant to.
[->]For example, if you specify Fire or Ice
as your condition...
[->]The search will return demons who Resist,
Null, Repel, or Drain that element.
[->]This condition can be invaluable if
you are building a force to combat
troublesome foes.
[->][END]
46: (Mido) [7a 0]This will allow you to use demons
registered in the Compendium for
components as well.
[->]In other words, component demons which
you do not have on hand can be summoned
directly into the fusion.
[->]The same amount of Macca is required to
summon them, so mind your finances.
[->]This condition can increase the
possibilities in fusion tremendously.
[->]And it will increase the number of
results in a search commensurately, so
you must narrow it down by other means.
[->]The broad range of possibilities that
this condition opens is fit only for
experts.
[->][END]
47: (Mido) [7a 0]This allows you to omit Elements from the
component demons.

condition to narrow your search.

48: (Mido) [7a 0]The Demon Compendium is a grimoire that

Compendium will become an important
tool in your journey.

list and examine their details to your
heart's content.
[->]You may also press [button 0] here to summon

[->]Take care that you use it deliberately
so as not to find yourself penniless.
[->][END]
50: (Mido) [7a 0]As you develop your demons, they will
begin to diverge from their entries in
the Demon Compendium.
[->]When this happens, you may register the
demon's current details in the Compendium,
overwriting its previous information.
[->]To do so, first go to the Cathedral of
Shadows' main menu...
[->]Select Demon Compendium, and then
Register.
[->]The resulting list will contain demons
whose current state diverges from their
recorded Compendium details.
[->]Select a demon and press [button 0] to
record the new details.
[->]You may also press [button 131072] to record all of
the demons' updated details at once.
[->][END]
51: (Mido) [7a 0]When updating the records in your Demon
Compendium, there is one thing to be
cautious of.
[->]Take care that a stronger version of a
demon in the Compendium is not displaced
by the weak one in your party.
[->]For example, you might use a well−
developed demon in fusion, eliminating
it from your stock.
[->]If you happened to befriend that same
demon through conversation again...
[->]The demon would be in its initial state,
putting you at risk of running afoul
of the case I mentioned.
[->]When you are considering whether or not
to update the records, press [button 196608] on the
register screen.
[->]This will display the demon's current
state and its Compendium record one
after another for easy comparison.
[->][END]
52: (Mido) [7a 0]Summoning from the Demon Compendium
requires a certain amount of Macca.
[->]It may interest you to know that the
summoning fee is dependent on the
recorded demon's quality.
[->]HP, MP, its statistics, elemental
affinities, and known skills are all
factors in determining the price.
[->]The stronger the demon, the higher the
cost of summoning it will be.
[->]Whether you opt for strength or savings
will pose quite a dilemma.
[->][END]
53: (Mido) [7a 0]”The record in the Compendium is too
strong! I can't afford the high cost of
summoning!”
[->]There are many users who express such
concerns, so allow me to tell you one
way to bypass this thorny problem.
[->]It's quite simple. All you have to do
is purposely replace the record with
a weaker version of the demon.
[->]Befriend a demon through conversation
to gain it in its initial state, and then
register that state to the Compendium.
[->]Employing this technique is counter to
the warning given elsewhere, but it
definitely has its uses.
[->][END]
54: (Mido) [7a 0]There are a series of laws that govern
demon fusion.
[->]What kind of demon the resulting demon
becomes is decided by the laws of
fusion, for instance.
[->]It is, of course, entirely possible to
fuse demons without knowing these laws...
[->]But it is best to be aware of them to
some extent to perform more refined
fusions.
[->][END]
55: (Mido) [7a 0]The race of the resulting demon depends
on which component demons are fused.
[->]For example, fusing race [Color:0x1]A[Color:0x0] with race [Color:0x1]B[Color:0x0]
will result in race [Color:0x1]C,[Color:0x0] and so forth.
[->]It is most useful to be conscious of this
law if you are seeking to fuse a demon
of a particular race.
[->]If you wish to make a demon of race [Color:0x1]C,[Color:0x0]
you will need component demons of races
[Color:0x1]A[Color:0x0] and [Color:0x1]B...[Color:0x0]
[->]With the reverse lookup, you can figure
out which races of component demon
to use.
[->][END]
56: (Mido) [7a 0]The resulting demon's level is decided
by the level of the component demons.
[->]The formula dictates that the averaged
level of the component demons is the
basis for the resulting demon's level.
[->]A strong demon is born from strong demons.
A weak demon is born from weak demons.
[->]It only stands to reason...
[->][END]
57: (Mido) [7a 0]If a component demon has gained any
levels, you must take care when
calculating the fusion result.
[->]This is because the formula dictated by
the laws of fusion...
[->]...takes only the component demon's
initial level into account, rather than
any it has accrued through experience.
[->]Even if you fused a Foul Slime at level
99, it would result in a very weak demon.
[->]It's important to remember that the
demon's initial strength is what
matters, not its current strength.
[->][END]
58: (Mido) [7a 0]Of the many races of demons, do you know
the idiosyncracies of the Elements?
[->]This Element race has a special and
rather technical role in fusion.
[->]It gets a bit complicated to explain,
but using them in fusions can greatly
influence your results.
[->]If you are confident in your skills,
you should by all means make an effort
to learn their use.
[->][END]
59: (Mido) [7a 0]To create an Element, simply fuse two
demons of the same race together.
[->]Which Element results from the fusion
is determined by the race of the
component demons used.
[->]If there is a specific Element you wish
to create, then narrow down your search
to the races that can create it...
[->]And then fuse two demons of that race
together.
[->][END]
60: (Mido) [7a 0]In order to understand an Element's
effect on fusion, you must first
understand the concept of ”ranks.”
[->]Rank is the order of each demon's level
within the same race.
[->]For example, if there were a demon [Color:0x1]A[Color:0x0]
of level 20...
[->]Within this race, you would look for
a higher−level demon than [Color:0x1]A.[Color:0x0]
[->]It happens that demon [Color:0x1]B,[Color:0x0] of level 25,
is the first one you find.
[->]In this case, demon [Color:0x1]B[Color:0x0] would be one rank
higher than demon [Color:0x1]A.[Color:0x0]
[->]Conversely, you could also say that
demon [Color:0x1]A[Color:0x0] is one rank lower than demon [Color:0x1]B.[Color:0x0]
[->][END]
61: (Mido) [7a 0]An Element's role in fusion is in essence
to manipulate the rank of your component
demons.
[->]For example, if you fused a certain
Element with demon [Color:0x1]A...[Color:0x0]
[->]The result would be a demon of [Color:0x1]A[Color:0x0]'s race,
but one rank above or below [Color:0x1]A.[Color:0x0]
[->]This amounts to manipulating [Color:0x1]A[Color:0x0]'s rank.
[->]Whether the rank increases or decreases
depends on [Color:0x1]A[Color:0x0]'s race, as well as the
Element fused with it.
[->]There would seem to be many combinations
where fusion is not possible...
[->]Learn well the web of compatibility
between the races and Elements.
[->][END]
62: (Mido) [7a 0]Demon fusions essentially follow certain
laws and proceed systematically...
[->]But very rarely, unexpected errors may
crop up during this process.
[->]When this happens, the resulting demon
will not be what you had planned for.
[->]...Even I have yet to figure out why such
a thing occurs.
[->]I highly doubt that there are any bugs
in the Cathedral of Shadows' code...
[->]Perhaps some mysterious power, unknown
even to me, is at play.
[->][END]
63: (Mido) [7a 0]Special fusion is a unique process where
the component demons are predetermined.
[->]These fusions are only possible through
specific combinations.
[->]That is why many of the demons created
through special fusion tend to be special
themselves.
[->]Try experimenting to see what kinds of
special fusions you can perform.
[->][END]
64: (Mido) [7a 0]There are four main ways in which special
fusion differs from normal fusion.
[->]First, the normal laws of fusion do
not apply.
[->]Second, the process is not limited to
only two component demons. It may
involve three or even four at times.
[->]Third, demons created through special
fusion cannot be created in any other
way.
[->]Not through normal fusion, and not
through fusion accidents.
[->]Fourth, even if the component demons
are the same, the resulting demon will
be different in a special fusion.
[->]For example, if demon [Color:0x1]A[Color:0x0] and demon [Color:0x1]B[Color:0x0]
fuse to create demon [Color:0x1]C[Color:0x0] through special
fusion...
[->]You would not get demon [Color:0x1]C[Color:0x0] by fusing
demon [Color:0x1]A[Color:0x0] and demon [Color:0x1]B[Color:0x0] in normal fusion.
[->]Remember these four points well...
[->][END]
65: (Mido) [7a 0]To use the special fusion feature,
first access the Cathedral of Shadows'
main menu...
[->]Then select Fusion and, from there,
Special Fusion.
[->][END]
66: (Mido) [7a 0]For special fusions, you first select the
demon you wish to create from the list.
[->]Once you have selected it, press [button 0] to
review which component demons the fusion
requires.
[->]By the way, there is one condition for
that demon to appear on the list...
[->]You must have befriended at least one
of its component demons in the past.
[->]You may wish to check the special fusion
list often as you befriend new demons.
[->][END]
67: (Mido) [7a 0]After deciding on the demon you wish to
create, check which component demons are
required for the fusion.
[->]At this time, component demons not
present in your stock will be supplied
automatically from the Compendium.
[->]After reviewing the combination, press
[button 0] to move on to your final check.
[->]Finally, press [button 0] once more to perform
the fusion.
[->][END]
68: (Mido) [7a 0]When performing special fusions, you may
come across demons listed as ”???”.
[->]This indicates that the demon's identity
is not yet known.
[->]If the resulting demon is listed as
???”, it means that not all of the
component demons have been acquired yet.
[->]If a component demon is listed as ”???”,
it means you have not yet befriended
that demon in some way.
[->]Despite this, the demon's race and level
will be legible, which should provide a
hint toward acquiring that demon.
[->][END]
69: (Mido) [7a 0]Fusion conditions show that a demon is
not currently available to be fused.
[->]Even if you are of an appropriate level,
and in possession of the right component
demons...
[->]Unless the fusion conditions are met,
you will be unable to create that demon.
[->]What this means in practice is...
[->]The Fusion Search does not reflect all
possible results. Special fusions will
not appear on the list.
[->]Their very existence is hidden.
[->]...Even I am not sure why this occurs.
I am currently looking into it.
[->][END]
70: (Mido) [7a 0]It seems that there are two ways to meet
fusion conditions.
[->]One is to fight the demon and defeat it.
[->]The other is to somehow enlist that
demon's help.
[->]Either way... you must make the demon
accept you as its master.
[->][END]
71: (Mido) [7a 0]There is an App that extends the
Cathedral of Shadows to allow you to
fuse demons even during battle.
[->]By installing the ”Fusion Lite” App on
Burroughs, you will gain access to this
functionality.
[->]However, since the Gauntlet is occupied
with various other processes during
battle...
[->]Only the simplest, most minimal functions
are enabled, so as not to overexert it.
[->]It permits a quick fusion between two
demons on hand. Skill inheritance is
handled automatically.
[->]This may seem to compare poorly with
the more fully−featured version...
[->]But the ability to fuse during battle
will surely open up new strategic
possibilities.

[->][13 0, 900011]Which is why I have prepared a useful
function called [Color:0x5]”Fusion Search.”[Color:0x0]
[->][13 0, 900012]This will allow you to search by
categories such as race, performance,
and skills to fuse your desired demon.
[->][END]
81: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 900013]I would recommend that beginners
simply perform a search without
changing any of the parameters.
[->][13 0, 900014]Doing so will display a list of demons
you are currently capable of fusing.
[->][13 0, 900015]If any of them catch your interest,
go ahead and fuse them.
[->][13 0, 900016]Once you get the hang of it, then you
can try adjusting some of the search
conditions.
[->][END]
82: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 900017]Now, apart from that, I've actually
prepared one other method of fusion
that's very basic.
[->][13 0, 900018]Look at those rows directly above
the menu. Do you see the icons with
demon faces?
[->][13 0, 900019]That is the ultimate time−saving
function... I call it [Color:0x5]”Recommended
Fusions.”[Color:0x0]
[->][13 0, 900020]It lists the top three demons you can
currently fuse, hand−picked by me.
[->][13 0, 900021]If any of them pique your interest,
you can select it and fuse it at once.
[->][13 0, 900022]You can be particular with the Fusion
Search or take the simple route of
Recommended Fusions.
[->][13 0, 900023]Use whatever style works best for you.
[->][END]
83: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 900017]Now, apart from that, I've actually
prepared one other method of fusion
that's very basic.
[->][13 0, 900033]Look at those rows directly above
the menu.
[->][13 0, 900019]That is the ultimate time−saving
function... I call it ”Recommended
Fusions.”
[->][13 0, 900020]It lists the top three demons you can
currently fuse, hand−picked by me.
[->][END]
84: [13 1, 903002]Unfortunately, there are no demons that
can be fused right now.
[->][13 1, 903001]When the tutorial is done, gather more
demons so that you can fuse them.
[->][13 1, 903004]Should you do so, Mido will make fusion
recommendations here...
[->][END]
85: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 900021]If any of them pique your interest,
you can select it and fuse it at once.

[->][13 0, 900023]Use whatever style works best for you.
[->][END]
86: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 900024]One last thing... I should say a few
words about the [Color:0x5]”Demon Compendium.”[Color:0x0]
[->][13 0, 900025]The Demon Compendium is a grimoire
where your demons' data is recorded.
[->][13 0, 900026]Not only can you view the data for the
demons you have fused or befriended...
[->][13 0, 900027]You can also summon those demons in
exchange for Macca.
[->][13 0, 900028]The more demons you encounter, the more
use you will get out of the Compendium.
[->][END]
87: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 900029]That concludes my lessons.
[->][13 0, 900030]If you want to learn more about
particular topics later, simply ask.
[->][13 0, 900031]Select [Color:0x5]”Talk”[Color:0x0] from the menu and you'll
be able to speak with me.
[->][END]
88: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 900032]And now, go and enjoy the wondrous
world of demons to your heart's content.
[->][END]
89: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 900100]Welcome to the Cathedral of Shadows,
where demons gather...
[->][END]
90: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 900101]ほう どうやらレギオンスキルを

93: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 900104]レギオンスキルとは

94: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 900109]そこで 新機能を用意しておいたぞ

96: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 901001]By the way, you seem to have handled
a startling number of quests so far.
[->][13 0, 901002]What? How can I know such a thing?
[->][13 0, 901003]Why, it's quite obvious if I look into
your Gauntlet's data.
[->][13 0, 901004]Hahahaha...
[->][END]
97: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 901005]That aside, about those quests...
[->][13 0, 901006]I'd like to request one of you myself.
[->][13 0, 901007]I want you to assist me in my research
on demons.
[->][13 0, 901008]I cannot offer much, but there will
be a reward as well. Not a bad deal,
is it?
[->][END]
98: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 901009]Thank you for taking the time to speak
with me. I actually have another
request for you.
[->][END]
99: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 901010]The details...? Well, it's something
along these lines.
[->][13 0, 901011]Let me transfer the data to Burroughs
right now.
[->][END]
100: (Burroughs) [13 0, 901012]Mido passed along some data.
I'll register it as a quest.
[->][END]
101: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 901013]All right, I'll be counting on you.
I expect excellent results.
[->][END]
102: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 901014]Is the request I gave you going
smoothly?
[->][END]
103: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 901015]Hm... it doesn't seem like you have
what I specified yet.
[->][13 0, 901016]Well, all I ask is that you continue
trying.
[->][END]
104: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 901017]Ah, it would seem that you have what
I specified.
[->][END]
105: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 901018]Hm, this is a fine report. Very useful
data. It will do a great deal for my
research...
[->][13 0, 901019]I hope you'd be willing to pitch in
again if something were to come up.
[->][END]
106: (Mido) [7a 0]This Cathedral of Shadows is stored on
a server. The Gauntlet acts as a terminal
to access it.
[->]In essence, all of Mikado's Samurai are
Cathedral of Shadows users.
[->]This year, you and four other new users
have been registered...
[->]Walter, Jonathan, Isabeau, Navarre,
and [Flynn]...
[->]I look forward to working with these
five new Samurai.
[->][END]
107: (Mido) [7a 0]If there is anything you don't understand
about fusion, you may ask me.
[->]Select a topic from the list below and
I will give you as clear an answer as
I am able.
[->]After you have digested what I have to
teach, all that's left is to fuse and
keep fusing...
[->]Experience is the greatest teacher,
after all.
[->][END]
108: (Mido) [7a 0]Once you grow accustomed to normal
fusion, try attempting special fusions.
[->]Demons created through special fusion
are generally quite strong...
[->]They will be reassuring allies when you
face powerful enemies.
[->][END]
109: (Mido) [7a 0]What was your initial reaction when
you saw Tokyo? Isn't it truly vast?
[->]There are many demons unknown to you
lurking in this land.
[->]Which means it is all the more abundant
in components for fusion...
[->]The Cathedral of Shadows will be your
oyster now! Hahahahahaha...
[->][END]
110: (Mido) [7a 0]As you face stronger demons, support
skills will play a more vital role.
[->]If you see a support skill in the list
of skills to inherit, you should think
carefully about what to keep.
[->]Are you certain you won't need that
support skill? Might you come to regret
that decision later?
[->]Give careful thought to such questions
when fusing...
[->][END]
111: (Mido) [7a 0]How many skill slots do your demons
have as yet?
[->]Your demons' skills will surely be
more abundant going forward.
[->]How many of these skills they can hold
at a time will be dependant on the
number of skill slots you provide.
[->]Whether or not to purchase more skill
slots for your demons is certainly
something to consider...
[->][END]
112: (Mido) [7a 0]Have you been making use of special
fusions?
[->]There are a limited number available
at first, but I'm sure the list has
become quite substantial now.
[->]If the component demons are unknown,
it can be diverting to try and guess
what they might be.
[->]Discovering the components, fusing the
special demons, and deploying their
strength in battle...
[->]Special fusion can be rewarding indeed.
[->][END]
113: (Mido) [7a 0]Have you experimented with using Elements
in your fusions?
[->]Manipulating rank with Elements is the
most straightforward way to strengthen
a demon.
[->]It does require some care. You must
understand the laws governing it and
prepare the proper Elemental...
[->]But the reward for taking such pains
will surely be significant.
[->]If ever you find yourself needing such
an ally, give it a try.
[->][END]
114: (Mido) [7a 0]I assume your Demon Compendium must
be quite substantial by now.
[->]Try allowing demons in your Compendium
to be used in fusion searches.
[->]You may be shocked at the expanded range
of possibilities that will result. You
could call it explosive...
[->]But then, the vast range of possibilities
could also prove overwhelming for you.
[->]Use your own judgement in setting your
conditions for a fusion search.
[->][END]
115: (Mido) [7a 0]The enemy demons will only be stronger
from this point on.
[->]It may be time to have your demons
specialize in a particular role, such as
attackers, supporters, or healers.
[->]You could also create well−rounded
demons, but you run the risk of them
falling short at a critical moment.
[->]The kind of demons you create will be
the true proof of your skills.
[->][END]
116: (Mido) [7a 0]You don't even understand your situation,
yet even so, you want to fuse demons...
[->]Amazing! That is how a true user of the
Cathedral of Shadows App should behave!
[->][END]
117: (Mido) [7a 0]The digital world where I live is
connected to all places.
[->]Thus, there is no difficulty in using
the Cathedral of Shadows App even from
the Tokyo you find yourself in now.
[->]Pay no mind to these trifling matters
and concentrate on your fusions as
usual.
[->][END]
118: (Mido) [7a 0]Have you encountered any fusion accidents
thus far?
[->]Fusion accidents are essentially a
flawed fusion resulting in an unforeseen
demon...
[->]However, they will sometimes result in
rare demons that cannot normally be
created through fusion.
[->]What starts as an unfortunate accident
could become a happy stroke of luck...
[->]This is one of the things that makes
fusion so mesmerizing.
[->][END]
119: (Mido) [7a 0]Your battle has reached its climax now...
The highest class of demons will be
making its appearances soon.
[->]Though I call it the highest class,
it contains quite a number of demons.
[->]Are you up to the challenge of creating
the best demons from within this
exalted class?
[->][END]
120: (Mido) [7a 0]You seem to have accomplished a great
mission.
[->]It is all thanks to your fusion of
steadfast demons through the Cathedral
of Shadows app.
[->]Knowing that it gave you the power to
change the world, I'm ready to call it
my true masterpiece.
[->]Hahahahaha...
[->][END]
