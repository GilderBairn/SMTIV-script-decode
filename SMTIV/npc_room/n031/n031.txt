0: (Far−gazing woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403302]Hey, whatever happened to that cocoon
in Shinjuku National Park?
[->]It flew off right before the ceiling
appeared... Maybe it's still up there.
[->]I wonder what happened to the ones
”chosen by God” who were inside?
[END]
1: (Far−gazing woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403312]On that day... I wish I'd stayed with
the cocoon in the park... I should have
found a way to stay with them...
[->]Who cares if I wasn't chosen by God!?
I just don't want demons to eat me!
[END]
2: (Far−gazing woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403303]When the cocoon took off from the park,
I felt like I'd flunked out of school
or something...
[->]But I don't care anymore. I can feel
the hope building inside Tokyo.
[END]
3: (Far−gazing woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403312]People are coming down now from up
above the ceiling... The Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado, right?
[->]Are they the same ones who were in the
cocoon in Shinjuku National Park? Then...
is my boy one of them...?
[->]I−I should give it up already... By now,
he'll have his own life. I shouldn't
interfere...
[END]
4: (Fierce−eyed man) [7a 60][13 1, 403211]Have you ever heard of angels? Yeah,
the things in the myths and such.
[->]Now, I'm not bullshitting you here,
but I almost got killed by an angel
one time.
[->]There was some other dude whose face
was cut to ribbons. Nasty stuff.
[END]
5: (Fierce−eyed man) [7a 60][13 1, 403212]Hear me out. I heard some stupid
bullshit, okay? They say angels are
coming down from the ceiling soon...
[->]But what if it's true? Just what if?
We've already got our hands full with
the demons... and now angels!?
[->]How screwed are we...!?
[END]
6: (Fierce−eyed man) [7a 60][13 1, 403242]H−Hey, champ... C−Can you listen to
this problem I got?
[->]I'm so worried about this rumor that
the angels are coming down here for
us... It's all a lie, right!?
[->]B−But if it's true... Just if...
Can you do something!? Angels are
so goddamned scary, man!
[END]
7: (Fierce−eyed man) [7a 60][13 1, 403242]H−Hey, champ... C−Can you listen to
this problem I got?
[->]I hear peace is coming back to Tokyo...
Do you really mean it!?
[->]My whole life is one worry after the
next. Now that the worries are gone,
not worrying is worrying me...
[END]
8: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403221]The Ashura−kai sure are violent. But hey,
you won't hear me complaining.
[->]Everyone knows we're still alive today
thanks to their stockpiles of stuff.
[->]Plus, the electricity they generate
let us live in safety in these
underground districts...
[END]
9: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403241]I was chatting with a dude who said he
was from someplace called the Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado...
[->]According to him, this ”Mikado” place
doesn't even have electricity!
[->]I don't know where that is in Tokyo,
but it sure sounds like a rough life
over there...
[END]
10: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403241]I was chatting with a dude who said he
was from someplace called the Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado...
[->]I was only half listening to him, but
the place sounds like a fertile land
with lots of greenery.
[->]If what he told me is true, I'd love
to visit this Eastern Kingdom of
Mikado someday...
[END]
11: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403241]Hey, I haven't seen that guy from the
Eastern Kingdom of Mikado...
[->]He told me that religion is a pretty
big thing there. I don't belive in
God, myself...
[->]But war is about to break out inside
Tokyo. If there is a God, I wish he'd
save us all.
[END]
12: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403221]Hey, have you seen that guy from the
Eastern Kingdom of Mikado?
[->]He said that the people there worship
God. If you see him again, can you
give him a message from me?
[->]”There are demons in Tokyo. Ask God
to do something about it.”
[END]
13: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403202]Did you guys see a man from the Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado there?
[->]I hear the people there worship God...
But I'd rather worship a champion over
something I can't actually see.
[->]”Champion”... Just the sound of it
is inspiring...
[END]
14: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403232]I saw a lot of unfamiliar faces in the
underground district today...
[->]When I talked to them, they said they
were from the Eastern Kingdom of
Mikado...
[->]They were marching to Kabuki−cho with
this white−haired, dignified man as
their leader...
[END]
100: (Far−gazing woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403302]There was a huge cocoon in Shinjuku
National Park...
[->]It took off into the sky right before
the ceiling showed up.
[->]I feel terrible for the people who had
family inside. They must be suffering
like you can't imagine...
[END]
104: (Fierce−eyed man) [7a 60][13 1, 403211]Have you ever heard of angels? Yeah,
the things in the myths and such.
[->]But angels do exist. It's true. If you
think I'm bullshitting you, go check
out Shinjuku National Park.
[->]There's a strange tower there... and if
you go inside... Nah, they must be dead
by now. The demons probably got 'em.
[END]
105: (Fierce−eyed man) [7a 60][13 1, 403212]Hear me out. I heard some stupid
bullshit, okay? They say angels are
coming down from the ceiling soon...
[->]But what if it's true? Just what if?
We've already got our hands full with
the demons... and now angels!?
[->]How screwed are we...!?
[END]
106: (Fierce−eyed man) [7a 60][13 1, 403242]H−Hey, champ... C−Can you listen to
this problem I got?
[->]I'm so worried about this rumor that
the Demon Lord is coming from Ichigaya
for us... It's all a lie, right!?
[->]B−But if it's true... Just if...
Can you do something!? We can't take
any more of those horrible demons!
[END]
200: (Far−gazing woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403302]There was a huge cocoon in Shinjuku
National Park...
[->]It took off into the sky right before
the ceiling showed up.
[->]That might have been the right move.
[END]
204: (Fierce−eyed man) [7a 60][13 1, 403211]Have you ever heard of angels? Yeah,
the things in the myths and such.
[->]But angels do exist. It's true. And
they're some nasty sons of bitches.
[->]There's a dude whose face got cut to
ribbons by some angels. You can see
him at Cafe Florida.
[END]
205: (Fierce−eyed man) [7a 60][13 1, 403212]Hear me out. I heard some stupid
bullshit, okay? They say angels are
coming down from the ceiling soon...
[->]But what if it's true? Just what if?
We've already got our hands full with
the demons... and now angels!?
[->]I wonder what Fujiwara and Skins are
gonna do about it...!?
[END]
305: (Fierce−eyed man) [7a 60][13 1, 403212]Hear me out. I heard some stupid
bullshit, okay? They say angels are
coming down from the ceiling soon...
[->]But I don't believe that. We've already
got our hands full with the demons...
[->]Fujiwara and Skins seem pretty calm
about it, though. I wonder why...
[END]
405: (Fierce−eyed man) [7a 60][13 1, 403212]Hey, do you know the guy who's made it
to third place on the scoreboard?
What was his name? [Flynn]?
[->]That's the cold−blooded killer
everyone's been talking about, right?
[->]Maybe he can kill all the demons in
Tokyo−−and those angels coming down
from the ceiling, too...
[END]

face of his? Angels. Not even kidding.
