0: (Dilettante Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403001]Heheh... If it's rare stuff you're
after, always take a look inside the
demons' Domains!
[->]Especially since the Ashura−kai don't
go in those. Which just means more
goodies for the rest of us!
[END]
1: (Dilettante Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403012]Ever since that pillar of light appeared
in Ichigaya, there's been a lot more
demons around...
[->]At this rate, how can I go out and
hunt for rare stuff!?
[END]
2: (Dilettante Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403002]An overall ranking, eh? Guess I can't
be wasting any time talkin'!
[->]I've gotta go out there and bring back
a bunch of rare finds! I'll smash any
demon that gets in my way!
[END]
3: (Dilettante Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403031]Once again, I picked myself up an
awesome rare find! Another masterpiece
for the collection!
[->]It's called... HOPE!
[END]
4: (Dilettante Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403001]All the stuff in my collection, they
know as ”mystic relics” in their home
kingdom...
[->]I think there are probably keen−eyed
men like me in lots of countries.
[END]
5: (Monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403633]This gentleman's collection is filled
with items the likes of which we've
never seen before...
[->]Tokyo certainly is brimming with
mystery! We must begin investigating
it as soon as we can!
[END]
6: (Suave man) [7a 121][13 1, 403001]I've been to Ikebukuro before. But all
the shops there were closed...
[->]If you wanna shop, guess you'll have
to do it in Shinjuku now. Well, time
I got back to Shibuya...
[END]
7: (Stern Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]This person is feeling unwell, so they
let us stay in this room...
[->]They are known as the Unclean Ones, but
nothing could be further from the truth!
[->]The people of Tokyo are merciful and
pure of heart...
[END]
8: (Quiet man) [7a 45][13 1, 403633]I didn't realize how hard it would be
to travel from the Eastern Kingdom of
Mikado to Tokyo...
[->]And that water the people of Tokyo
offered to me... I never thought that
simple water could be so refreshing...
[->]I daren't give up now... For the sake
of those unable to travel to this new
world with me...
[->]And for myself, who blindly relied on
God and performed no good works...
[END]
9: (Hunter man) [7a 118][13 1, 403001]I heard about you guys from Fujiwara...
[->]Think of Tokyo as your family home or
something. You can let it all hang
out here.
[END]
10: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]Hey, you've seen a girl, right? She
looks teenaged, wears a school
uniform...
[->]I remember... When I was sealed inside
Tokyo, I was her age...
[END]
11: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]I actually live in Atsugi... I was in
Shinjuku for some shopping that day.
[->]My friend is gone now... I'm alone...
[END]
12: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]Huh? There's a Sanctuary in Shinjuku?
[->]Well... there's a place called Harajuku
there. That's kind of a sanctuary for
teenagers craving radical new fashions.
[->]Oh? That's not the kind of sanctuary
you meant?
[END]
13: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]Once I had a Hunter I met in Shinjuku
take me to Shibuya.
[->]It was fun... we had a few laughs,
a few drinks... For a little while,
I forgot all about the ceiling...
[->]But I guess I can't be that naive
anymore...
[END]
14: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]I'm originally from Atsugi. I was
shopping in Shinjuku when that ceiling
appeared...
[->]I had a friend who stayed with me.
We talked a lot about how much we
wanted to go to Roppongi...
[->]But then... that friend of mine ate
one of the red pills...
[END]
15: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]By the way, a little while before the
ceiling appeared, these strange−looking
people tried to talk to me.
[->]They were with some kind of religion.
They wanted to take me to Tsukiji
Hongwanji...
[END]
16: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]By the way, a little while before the
ceiling appeared, these strange−looking
people tried to talk to me.
[->]They were with some kind of religion.
They wanted to take me to Tsukiji
Hongwanji...
[END]
17: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]The Yakuza and those cultists are about
to go to war, huh?
[->]Please... get me out of here! I don't
want to stay in Tokyo anymore! I'm
begging you, get me out of Tokyo...!
[END]
18: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]It's just like 25 years ago... demons
came to Tokyo and slaughtered so many
people...
[->]If history is about to repeat itself,
I wish the ceiling wasn't there so
we could accept God's wrath...
[END]
19: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]Someone created that ceiling...
[->]And then a champion arrived...
[->]But I'm the same as I was 25 years ago.
I haven't grown up. I still just cling
to the hope that someone will save me...
[END]
100: (Dilettante Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403001]The tower in Shinjuku National Park is
under heavy guard by the Ashura−kai.
[->]It's not like there's anything worth
looting in the place... Why do they
have such an intense interest in it?
[END]
200: (Dilettante Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403031]Everyone has their own complaints about
life in Tokyo. But if you keep your eyes
open, you'll find plenty of fun here...
[->]Like... infiltrating Domains to search
for rare loot!
[END]
1000: (Dilettante Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403001]Hm? Are you from the station underground
district? So... you're targeting that
demon in the government office, huh?
[->]Well then, it's not here you want.
Go outside from the northwest gate of
the station underground district.
[->]Then go west from the west entrance
and you'll find the foyer of the
Metropolitan Government office.
[END]
