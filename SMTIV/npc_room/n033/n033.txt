0: (Scrupulous Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403041]Ah, a fellow Samurai! It's so good
to see you here.
[->]I just received an interesting tip from
a lady. She said that we can find books
at a place called Ikebukuro.
[->]That may be just the place to begin our
hunt for the Black Samurai...
[END]
1: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403041]Ah, my fellow Samurai. What a strange
coincidence. Are you here to salvage
relics as well?
[->]Rumor has it that there is some sort
of ”sanctuary” within Tokyo.
[->]Our kingdom, too, has a sanctuary...
Though I've not set foot in it for
a very long time.
[END]
2: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403041]Ah, my fellow Samurai. What a strange
coincidence. Are you here to salvage
relics as well?
[->]By the by, have you seen any of our
other fellows here? One of them came
to Shinjuku with me...
[->]Well, Tokyo is vast. I'm sure he's
looking for relics on his own
somewhere...
[END]
3: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]Demons were spreading a rumor that the
angels were mounting an attack from
above the Firmament.
[->]I've heard nothing about this. I hope
that we don't find ourselves caught in
the midst of an assault...
[END]
4: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403011]I hear that the Eastern Kingdom of
Mikado has been reborn as a land
governed by God and His angels.
[->]The kingdom as we knew it is no
more, I fear...
[END]
5: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403041]What's this? When did you become the
champion of the Hunters?
[->]My God, man... I must commend you
for your determined spirit.
[END]
6: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]Hoy! Is it true that all of our
countrymen in the kingdom are
coming here to Tokyo?
[->]Th−This is unprecedented... Why, the
immense scale of such a thing...!
[END]
7: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]Shinjuku and Shene Duque... Not only
those, either. There are similarities
to be found in names all over...
[->]Perhaps the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado
was built on the nostalgia of King
Aquila himself.
[END]
102: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403022]One of our fellows has been captured
by an Unclean One named Tayama...
[->]But Abbot Hugo told me to concentrate on
salvaging relics and that you would
negotiate his release.
[->]This sense of unease I feel toward Abbot
Hugo only grows stronger... Please look
after our fellow Samurai.
[END]
202: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403043]Hoy, did something happen to your band?
I saw Walter wandering alone...
[->]It seemed that he was going to K...
Kabu... Kabukucho...
[END]
302: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403043]I've just seen Walter traveling on
his own. But weren't the four of you
working as a team?
[->]Tokyo is a strange land to us. We must
help our fellow Samurai in order to
accomplish our tasks.
[END]
402: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403043]Hm? You didn't receive the order to
report back to Mikado Castle?
[->]Abbot Hugo's wishes were for us to
forget our fellow held captive by
Tayama...
[->]This sense of unease I feel toward Abbot
Hugo only grows stronger... Nevertheless,
orders are to be obeyed.
[END]
