0: (Male ghost) [7a 101][13 1, 404541]If I'd known I'd end up like this, I'd
have lived life only for myself...
[->]I should've stayed out of Shibuya. It
wasn't like me to let my conscience
drive me to this town...
[END]
1: (Male ghost) [7a 101][13 1, 404541]I wonder if my life had any meaning...
I was born, risked my life, and died in
Tokyo for someone I don't even know.
[->]But if you'll let me brag for a second...
I think I was kinda cool. Hahaha...!
[END]
2: (Female ghost) [7a 102][13 1, 404621]Everyone did their part to fight... But
in the end, they were exhausted.
[->]My only regret is that I couldn't fight
until the very end...
[END]
3: (Female ghost) [7a 102][13 1, 404602]The rest is up to you... It's in your
hands now. Please carry our hopes
forward...
