0: (Female demonoid) [7a 147][13 1, 418002]I'm sure Akira wishes he could ditch
this tiny base and move out to the
center of the city...
[->]But he doesn't have the firepower.
Not enough soldiers, you know? He's
trying to find good allies nearby.
[END]
1: (Female demonoid) [7a 147][13 1, 418002]When Akira starts to get drunk around
his people, he always rambles on about
his dream...
[->]He says he doesn't want his people
cooped up in this tiny base. He wants
to set them up in central Tokyo...
[->]But he needs more men to pull that off.
I wonder if there are any good soldiers
for hire out there...

his dream...
[->]He says he doesn't want his people
cooped up in this tiny base. He wants
to set them up in central Tokyo...
[->]But that guy's all talk. He's got no
muscle to back it up. Then again, he's
also a guy who keeps his promises...
[->]With the Intruders on his side, he just
might make that dream come true...

3: (Female neurisher) [7a 147][13 1, 418002]The only way for weaklings to survive
in this world is to become neurishers.

4: (Female demonoid) [7a 148][13 1, 417203]They give their thoughtpeaches to the
demonoids as food, in exchange for
the right to live.

5: (Female demonoid) [7a 147][13 1, 418004]You there! Have you finished with
today's harvest? Slack off and you're
dead, you hear?
[END]
6: (Female demonoid) [7a 147][13 1, 418002]It was Kenji who proposed the idea of
making humans into neurishers.
[->]Thanks to him, all our food problems
are solved. He's not only strong,
but smart too.
[END]
7: (Female demonoid) [7a 148][13 1, 417203]Speaking of smart, you know who else is
clever? Akira.
[->]He's got a motto... ”Don't pick fights
unless you know you can win.”
[END]
8: (Female demonoid) [7a 147][13 1, 418003]Must be how he's still alive in this
hellhole.
[END]
9: (Female demonoid) [7a 148][13 1, 417207]Yeah... just don't count on his muscle,
though. He ain't got any.
[END]
10: (Female demonoid) [7a 147][13 1, 418002]The Counter−Demon Force that Kenji used
to belong to was a special organization
made to drive the demons from Tokyo.

11: (Female demonoid) [7a 148][13 1, 417203]It was formed about 25 years ago when
a war between demons and angels had
broken out in Tokyo.
[END]
12: (Female demonoid) [7a 147][13 1, 418003]Kenji later threw in with the demons,
who had been his enemies up to then,
to defeat the forces of the angels.
[END]
13: (Female demonoid) [7a 148][13 1, 417203]Ever since then, it's been the rule of
the strongest in Tokyo. And Kenji is
the King.
[->]You might say Tokyo of the last 25
years has been the Kenji era.

14: (Male demonoid) [7a 146][13 1, 415201]Daaaaamn! I'm so pissed off! I just
wanna smack someone right now...!
[->]Heh, and with no cops or law in this
city anymore, who's gonna stop me!?
[END]
15: (Female demonoid) [7a 146][13 1, 415200]Daaaaamn! I'm so pissed off! I'm dying

18: (Male demonoid) [7a 146][13 1, 415200]Hey, you killed the boss of Shinjuku,
right? That's great... like how it feels
when you give someone a good smack!
[->]We was told to guard this place. You're
off to whack Kenji, right?
[->]Hey Intruders, go kick some ass for
me too while you're out!
[END]
19: (Male demonoid) [7a 146][13 1, 415201]Hey, you killed the boss of Shinjuku,
right? That's great... like how it feels

King Akira's orders.
[END]
20: (Male demonoid) [7a 146][13 1, 415201]Hey, we was told to guard this place.
King Akira's orders, man.
[->]I wonder what's Akira doing now...
He seems pretty busy nowadays. We can't
get in to see him.
[END]
21: (Akira) [7a 85][13 1, 401701]Huh!? What brings you glorious
Intruders here? Why come to
Kasumigaseki...?
[->]Kenji is in Camp Ichigaya. He has the
remote, too.
[->]But... I need to start worrying about
Shinjuku too, not just Kasumigaseki.
[->]And if I become King of Tokyo, won't I
have to worry about the whole city...?
Man, this is sounding pretty hard...
