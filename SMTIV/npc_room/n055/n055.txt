0: (Isabeau) [7a 5][13 1, 400301]I was startled when the Gauntlet gleamed
during the Rite as well. It's all so
very mysterious...
[->]But this ”Burroughs,” was it? I'm very
reassured to have her guidance.
[END]
1: (Timid Samurai) [7a 117]I see... True, you have only just
finished your training. Be sure that
you rest well, yes?
[END]
2: (Timid Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403042]Thinking on it, I had assumed that it
would be simplicity itself to find relics
in the cavern...
[->]But now we are destined for the Unclean
Ones' country, which we do not know for
a certainty exists, yes?
[->]I am beginning to regret the day I was
chosen as a Samurai...
[END]
3: (Angel) [7a 65463][13 1, 412102]Ah, warrior of light. I can sense your
holy shine... the Lord's blessing
emanating from you.
[->]Our Lord is surely eager for you to
annihilate the Filth below.
[->]Go and defeat the demons to restore
order and peace to His chosen sons
of man.
[END]
4: (天使) [7a 65460][13 1, 412000][神/かみ]よ [私/わたし]たちにご[加護/かご]を…
[END]
6: (Honest Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403003]You do well to step so fearlessly into
Naraku, my brilliant fellow Samurai.
[->]Forgive me for being forward, but if you
like, I could share some knowledge on
the finer points of the Samurai trade.
[END]
7: Ask him for advice
Decline his offer
[END]
8: (Honest Samurai) [7a 116]We Samurai are charged with performing
two primary roles...
[->]First, we must slay the demons that
continue to appear in Naraku.
[->]”Demons” are monsters which attack humans
on sight. They must be slain before they
escape into the wild.
[->]Our other task relates to mystic relics.
But you should ask the others further
within about these.
[END]
9: (Honest Samurai) [7a 116]Ah, what a shame. If you think better
of it, I shall be here.
[END]
10: (Angel) [7a 65463][13 1, 412105]You, son of man who rejected our Lord's
salvation and chose the thorned path...
[->]There can be no peace without the Lord's
blessing. That is because the creator of
all things is...
[->]But I need not finish that thought.
So then, until the day you require us
once more...
[END]
11: (Angel) [7a 65463][13 1, 412105]You who have rejected the temptation of
the demons and chosen to remain a son
of man...
[->]Your kind and the demons will be separate
for a time, just as are. But the day of
reunion will be not long in coming.
[->]Since days of old, the sons of man have
been fertile soil for the demonic.
That is why we exist...
[END]
100: (Isabeau) [7a 5][13 1, 400302]”Find an 'article of interest'”!
'Tis like trying to grapple with fog...
[->]But if this is what makes a Samurai, then
I shall rise to the challenge!
[END]
101: (Timid Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403002]Hoy, prentice. Working hard at your
training, I hope?
[->]Would you like a bit of guidance? Call
it an extracurricular lesson...
[END]
102: (Timid Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403042]A−Ah, it's you... You've reached the
Unclean Ones' country, they tell me.
[->]Now I've no excuses left to make...
I, too, must eventually venture into
the land called Tokyo.
[->]I am beginning to regret the day I was
chosen as a Samurai...
[END]
200: (Isabeau) [7a 5][13 1, 400301]These Challenge Quests... They are more
rigorous than I had thought.
[->]The Samurai must be a doughty crew
indeed if these are what they consider
idle entertainment.
[END]
201: Ask him for advice
Decline his offer
[END]
300: (Isabeau) [7a 5][13 1, 400301]I saw Walter but a moment ago, talking
with one of the Masters.
[->]After that, I know not where he went.
Though I think it may have been deeper
into Naraku...
[END]
301: (Timid Samurai) [7a 117]There are mystic objects known as [Color:0x5]relics[Color:0x0]
buried within Naraku that cannot be
found aboveground.
[->]I do not know their true nature, but you
lose nothing by collecting them.
[->]They are found everywhere within Naraku.
Should you find any, I suggest that you
hold on to them.
[END]
401: (Timid Samurai) [7a 117]Ah, but you are in the midst of training!
I am sorry to have disturbed you.
[END]
501: (Timid Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403002]Hoy, prentice. Working hard at your
training, I hope?
[->]Would you like a bit of guidance? Call
it an extracurricular lesson...
