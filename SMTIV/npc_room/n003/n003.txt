1: (Arrogant man) [7a 24][13 1, 403611]There seem to be more Casualries now
who can read the mystic script...
[->]Take that baker in the castle town.
He even labels his wares in the script.
[->]We Luxurors study the script at a young
age in school, but how and where did
THEY learn it?
[END]
2: (Arrogant man) [7a 24][13 1, 403641]There seem to be more Casualries now
who can read the mystic script...

by reading Literature written in the
language.
[->]But books written in the mystic script
are extremely hard to come by... Just
where did they happen upon theirs?

3: (Arrogant man) [7a 24][13 1, 403621]I've heard that the Black Samurai was
disseminating Literature written in the
mystic script.

handing out such precious volumes to
those ignorant louts?
[->]Ah well... I've more pressing concerns
than a fool who was just executed.
[END]
4: (Arrogant man) [7a 24][13 1, 403603]Just as our God is one and only...
We do not need two languages in this
kingdom.
[->]I'm ashamed of myself. To think I was
once so proud to have mastered the
mystic script...
[END]
5: (Gentle woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403731]I was born a Luxuror. My unborn child
will be a Luxuror. As will all his
descendants...
[->]In the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado, we
are all born to a purpose that God has
given us, unto our last descendant.
[END]
6: (Gentle woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403741]I saw a band of Samurai today near the
castle gate, departing on an expedition.
I'd never seen them thus before.
[->]That white−haired gentleman on the
front line... I wonder if he would
care a fig for the age difference...
[->]Oh... Oh, my! Did I say that out...
P−Please, forget you heard anything!
[END]
7: (Gentle woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403721]I saw a band of Samurai departing on
a mission...
[->]I've heard that their task is to conduct
an inspection of many towns across the
Eastern Kingdom of Mikado...
[->]Alas... I did not see the dignified
gentleman with white hair among their
number...
[END]
8: (Gentle woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403722]At last, I recently had the fortune to
meet that gentleman before he departed
on another mission!
[->]The white−haired Samurai's name is...
Commander Hope.
[->]I should be thankful to have got that
much out of him. He seemed to have very
pressing business that day...

Commander Hope.
[->]Master Hope and I were both chosen by
God as subjects of this kingdom... I am
honored to count him as a countryman.
[END]
10: (Gentle woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403722]Master Hope has many errands all across
the kingdom each day...
[->]But his absence has done nothing to
quench my feelings for him...
[->]If I could put one question to God,
'twould be this: Why did you teach me
the sensation of love...?
[END]
11: (Gentle woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403721]A Samurai woman called Isabeau was
here not long ago.
[->]She told me to prepare for a journey and
then went straight for Mikado Castle.
[END]
102: (Arrogant man) [7a 24][13 1, 403641]There seem to be more Casualries now
who can read the mystic script...
[->]I've heard that the Literature provided
by the Black Samurai was written in
that script.

107: (Gentle woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403721]That dignified gentleman with the white
hair who leads the other Samurai...
[->]He has been scurrying across the Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado most every day.
[->]I know this, for I watch him every day.
And that is how I know that he is
fearful of something...

210: (Demon) [7a 65327][13 1, 412100]So what's that ”sensation of love” this
woman has inside taste like...?
[->]Is it sweet?  Or could it be sour...?
Maybe a little bit of both?
[->][13 1, 412101]It would be too frustrating to wait for
her to be converted to Reds... Maybe I
should nibble on her brain directly, ha.
