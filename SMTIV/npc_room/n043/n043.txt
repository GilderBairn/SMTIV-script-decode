0: (Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403002]There is a rumor that the Ashura−kai's
headquarters are located in Roppongi,
near Shibuya.
[->]We must act cautiously so as not to
draw undue attention...
[END]
1: (Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403042]I hear SOMEONE had made a big commotion in a place called Club Milton.
[->]Geez... I don't mind you get yourself in a combat...
But don't you draw Ashura−kai's attention too much, you hear?
[END]
2: (Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403042]I saw Walter just now.
But he was acting strangely. 
[->]He was heading for Shibuya leading the believers of Ring of Gaea.
[->]Whatever happened to him...?
Do you know anything?
[END]
3: (Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403011]To continue with our mission in this state is impossible.
I even hear a rumor about angels are coming to attack...
[->]Why the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado won't retreat all the Samurai in Tokyo...?
[->]D−Don't tell me they are thinking to abandon us here...
[END]
4: (Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403011]The Eastern Kingdom of Mikado has transioned to a new governing structure...
A system where god and angels rule...
[->]I hear the Luxrors are gone, and statue of King Aquila has been destroyed.
[->]I feel like my loyalty towards the kingdom is fading away...
[END]
5: (Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403043]Hey, you made the Top 3 of Overall Ranking!
[->]My... Your tenacious effort sure is amazing...
[END]
6: [->][END]
7: [->][END]
8: (Dignified Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403002]Ah, it's you! I received the message
from Isabeau.
[->]The evacuation of our countrymen to
Tokyo is proceeding as planned.
[->]The people ought to be en route to
Shinjuku now. I am staying here to act
as a guide along the way.
[END]
9: (Hunter man) [7a 69][13 1, 403041]Say, you guys looking for Reds too?
Don't waste your time at Club Milton.
[->]I just went there. The manager'll just
kick you out.
[END]
10: (ハンターの男) [7a 69][13 1, 403041][->][END]
11: (Hunter man) [7a 69][13 1, 403021]Club Milton is still open even though
Tokyo's such a mess...
[->]Or maybe I should say Club Milton's
still open because Tokyo's such a mess.
[->]I also heard some guys in Shibuya's
underground ate the Reds to become
demons. Anything goes in Tokyo now...
[END]
12: (Hunter man) [7a 69][13 1, 403021]The Association started a new event.
A tournament or something...
[->]Then more Hunters started to buy Reds,
and the usual customers are flowing
into Milton now.
[->]I can see the real story behind it
all... So you'll excuse me if I'm not
so excited about this big event.
[END]
13: (Hunter man) [7a 69][13 1, 403033]That last surge was astonishing!
[Flynn] made a huge jump!
[->]Those Hunters in Milton who ate the
Reds must be kicking themselves now.
[->]If they'd known a shining hope like
this would rise up... I bet they'd
have made a different choice.
[END]
14: (Hunter man) [7a 69][13 1, 403033]We Hunters can kill the demons outside
one by one...
[->]The problem is the ex−Hunters who turned
into demons after eating those Reds.
[->]Should we just kill them all and get it
over with? Or should we spare them and
set up a reservation for them to live?
[END]
102: (Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403042]Guys from Ashura−kai are running around insanely.
[->]...Oh well, we're on a mission to hunt down the Black Samurai...
[->]We should keep the unnecessary worries out of our heads and prepare for it.
[END]
111: (Hunter man) [7a 69][13 1, 403021]The Association was hyping up some
event that's supposed to start soon.
[->]Then more Hunters started to buy Reds,
and the usual customers are flowing
into Milton now.
[->]I can see the real story behind it
all... So you'll excuse me if I'm not
so excited about this big event.
[END]
112: (Hunter man) [7a 69][13 1, 403021]That tournament the Association started
is really catching on.
[->]Tokyo's Hunters are desperate to keep
up with this [Flynn] guy...

Reds must be kicking themselves now.
