0: (Shinjuku demonoid) [7a 104][13 1, 417105]Akira? Isn't he that little fish in
Nagata−Cho? What's gotten into him?
[->]He's got to be pulling some kind of
cheap trick! He has to be...!
[END]
1: (Shinjuku demonoid) [7a 104][13 1, 417105]Akira's that little fish in Nagata−Cho,
right? How'd he get to be the King of
Tokyo?
[->]He must have pulled some kind of
cheap trick! He must've...!
[END]
2: (Male neurisher) [7a 107][13 1, 403441]A guy called Akira just showed up here
and told us neurishers to take a bath
every day...
[->]Maybe dirty neurishers don't taste as
good to them. But he's the only guy
who's ever treated us like real humans...
[->]Kind of a weird demonoid, that guy...
[END]
3: (Male neurisher) [7a 107][13 1, 403441]King Akira just showed up here. He said
us neurishers had to get at least eight
hours sleep a day.
[->]Maybe unhealthy neurishers don't taste
as good to them. But he's the only guy
who's ever treated us like real humans...
[->]Kind of a weird demonoid, that guy...
[END]
4: (Female neurisher) [7a 106][13 1, 403501]...Who's there? Are you my new owner...?
Sorry... My eyesight's not so good...
[->]I won't run... so please be nice...
[END]
5: (Female neurisher) [7a 106][13 1, 403501]You know, I can't see, but my ears work
fine. So I can tell a lot about people
by listening to their voices.
[->]I just heard King Akira's voice. He's
good at suppressing his real feelings...
[->]He probably had to force himself to
toughen up and fight after he became
a demonoid...
[END]
6: (Male demonoid) [7a 146][13 1, 412007]We cleaned out all the Shinjuku folks
in this town.
[->]Wouldn't want to get stabbed in the
back, right? Huh...? What do you mean,
my ”fellow demons”?
[->]Listen, friends. Losers get whacked.
That's the only rule here in Tokyo,
you get me?
[END]
7: (Male demonoid) [7a 146][13 1, 412003]Our Kasumigaseki crew has rubbed out
all the old Shinjuku folks.
[->]Wouldn't want to get stabbed in the
back, right? Huh...? What do you mean,
my ”fellow demons”?
[->]Listen, friends. Losers get whacked.
That's the only rule here in Tokyo,
you get me?
[END]
8: (Female neurisher) [7a 110][13 1, 403342]Huh? You're from Kasumigaseki? You mean
you're from Akira's sorry crew...?
[->]I feel sorry for the neurishers stuck
with those losers.
[->]They probably never get a moment's rest,
since such a tiny, weak crew can't
possibly own many neurishers...
[END]
9: (Female neurisher) [7a 110][13 1, 403342]These aren't the only neurishers we've
got, you know. There's also a few
from Kasumigaseki.
[->]Since we have enough to go around,
Akira told us to take turns feeding
the demonoids.
[->]They gave me the odd−numbered days.
You see? Akira's not so bad...
[END]
10: (Female neurisher) [7a 110][13 1, 403342]There are two types of neurishers in
Shinjuku: The ones here from the start,
and those from Kasumigaseki.
[->]Since we have enough to go around,
King Akira told us to take turns
feeding the demonoids.
[->]They gave me the odd−numbered days.
King Akira's a pretty cool guy, huh?
[END]
11: (Female neurisher) [7a 110][13 1, 403342]There are two types of neurishers in
Shinjuku: The ones here from the start,
and those from Kasumigaseki.
[->]Since we have enough to go around,
King Akira told us to take turns

[->]They gave me the odd−numbered days.
Heh... I wouldn't mind dating that
King Akira, you know...
[END]
13: (Male neurisher) [7a 105][13 1, 403212]I know it was my own decision, but
becoming a neurisher was such a
terrible idea...
[->]I feel like a cow or something... Only
alive to feed those above me on the
food chain...
[->]Sometimes I wonder what life would be
like if I'd chosen differently at
Ichigaya that day...
[END]
14: (Male neurisher) [7a 105][13 1, 403212]Around the time Kenji, who'd just become
a demonoid, defeated the demon in
Ichigaya and became King of Tokyo...
[->]He declared that all residents of Tokyo
must choose to become either neurishers
or demonoids.
[->]Kenji's men took all the normal humans
left in Tokyo to Ichigaya...
[->]There, we were forced to undergo
surgery. Of course, he let us choose
which operation we wanted...
[END]
15: (Male neurisher) [7a 105][13 1, 403212]If you've seen Kenji, maybe you've
seen this too...
[->]You went to a lab in Camp Ichigaya,
didn't you? In a way, that was the
birthplace for us all...
[->]Since there are no normal humans left
in Tokyo, that lab will never again
see use, I'm sure...
[END]
16: (Male neurisher) [7a 105][13 1, 403243]This is just a rumor... But I heard
there was a baby born in Kasumigaseki?
[->]So... what do you think it'll grow up
to be? A demonoid? Or a neurisher...?
[->]I guess we can let him decide for
himself down the line. Maybe he'll even
have a chance to stay normal...
[END]
101: (Male neurisher) [7a 107][13 1, 403441]Kenji's got Shibuya and Ikebukuro under
his control. The only region that's not
under his thumb now is Shinjuku...
[->]Oh yeah, I almost forgot. Some dude
named Akira is making a play for
Kasumigaseki...
[END]
103: (Male neurisher) [7a 107][13 1, 403441]King Akira came here the other day and
told us neurishers we should get three
square meals a day, same as everyone.
[->]Maybe skinny neurishers don't taste
as good to them. But he's the only guy
who's ever treated us like real humans...
[->]Kind of a weird demonoid, that guy...
[END]
105: (Male demonoid) [7a 146][13 1, 415006]Whaaa? Our boss? He's over inside that
Domain past the elevator...
[->]But he's not someone Akira can see
without an appointment. Get your ass
out before you get yourself killed.
[END]
107: (Male demonoid) [7a 146][13 1, 412003]Our Kasumigaseki crew has already rubbed
out all the old Shinjuku folks.
[->]Wouldn't want to get stabbed in the
back, right? Huh...? What do you mean,
my ”fellow demons”?
[->]Listen, friends. Losers get whacked.
That's the only rule here in Tokyo,
you get me?
[END]
203: (Female neurisher) [7a 106][13 1, 403501]...Who goes there...? Is anyone there?
Sorry... My eyesight's not so good...
[->]I won't run... so please be nice...
