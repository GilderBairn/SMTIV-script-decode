0: (Patrolling Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]Today is like any other peaceful day
in the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado.
No sign of conflicts or strife.
[->]There were a few of the usual skirmishes,
of course, but nothing like what a Samurai
might face elsewhere.
[END]
1: (Patrolling Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]Hail, fellow prentices. Are you growing
accustomed to being Samurai?
[->]You have proven yourselves in the
”field exercise” and the teachings of
Sir K. You have done well.
[->]Seize today to relax and make merry
like the youths you are.
[END]
2: (Patrolling Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]Dummy Message
[END]
3: (Patrolling Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403011]I have heard that the Monastery is
ready to formally declare the reading
of Literature to be anathema.
[->]What will I tell the people if they
ask me why? Shall I be direct and say
it turns one into a demon...?
[->]I am not certain how to answer such
a question...
[END]
4: (Patrolling Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]We've searched the people's homes while
they attended the public execution...
[->]Much Literature has been confiscated.
Though I doubt the people have given
up their passion for it...
[END]
5: (Patrolling Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]I'll tell you what I have experienced
of late, but I must preface it by
insisting that I have not gone mad.
[->]I had the honor of seeing our new
leader in a dream... Her inconceivably
warm voice encouraged me...
[->]The next day, I found that the people
had regained their peace, as if they
had been exorcised...
[END]
6: (Patrolling Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]Today is like any other peaceful day
in the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado.
No sign of conflicts or strife.
[->]Our new leaders have informed us that no
more Black Samurai shall emerge in
this kingdom.
[->]We will at last be rid of the demons
that tormented our kingdom for so long...
[END]
7: (Patrolling Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]I love my fellow subjects dearly.
But at the same time, they are the
seedbeds of the demons...
[->]Does the Samurai code compel me to
protect the roots of this evil? I felt
conflicted over my duties...
[->]But then I saw Isabeau dashing about,
desperate to pacify and listen to the
people.
[->]I understand now that I needn't
rationalize it at all. I love both
the kingdom and its people...
[END]
8: (Guiding Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403002]Hello. Are you two here for the
Gauntlet ceremony?
[->]Then you'll want to go inside Mikado
Castle and make for the Aquila Statue
Plaza.
[END]
9: (Guiding Samurai) [7a 115][13 1, 403001]Do not be fooled by my clothing.
I, too, am a Samurai.
[->]I am conducting a mission incognito,
you see. You might say I am looking
for a suspicious person...
[->]In recent days, the man has seemed to
enter and exit the castle town quite
frequently.
[->]The scuttlebutt is that the man is
providing something to the Casualries.
[->]I've been watching from this post since
morning, though. I suppose he may not
show his face today...
[END]
10: (Guiding Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403043]The Black Samurai has been sighted in
many places around Mikado.
[->]The first sightings were in Cheoda and
Setteguye, but she has been seen all
around the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado.
[->]I must say, it's hard to believe. How
can she move so quickly in so short
a time?
[END]
11: (Guiding Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403002]The Black Samurai said she would
live again...
[->]The subjects who attended the public
execution spread word of her claim far
and wide across Mikado.
[->]In some regions, they are only holding
more Sabbaths to pray for her revival!
This turn of events is alarming...
[END]
12: (Guiding Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403022]In many regions of the kingdom, those
who supported the Black Samurai or took
part in Sabbaths have disappeared.
[->]Perhaps it was God's wrath, as our
new leader would have it.
[->]People in this kingdom now fear and
respect God... it has brought down the
number of Sabbaths held dramatically.
[END]
13: (Guiding Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403002]On advice from our new leaders, we are
conducting a loyalty test in many
regions across the kingdom.
[->]We show an image of the Black Samurai
and see if a subject is willing to
trample it underfoot.
[->]This splendid idea will allow us to root
out what demon forces remain. Soon, our
kingdom shall be free from their curse.
[END]
14: (Guiding Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403001]Some of the people, upset that the new
leaders make no public appearances,
have started to hold Sabbaths again.
[->]It has forced me to think about one
thing I should have considered sooner.
Why we control the friendly demons...
[->]After all, humans and demons are but
two sides of a coin. Perhaps we should
not be separated...
[->]It may be better to attempt to live in
harmony with them. There may be one out
there testing this point...
[END]
15: (Demon) [7a 65225][13 1, 411007]I swear, the people in this country...
Are they nuts!? C'mon, look at me!
I'm a frickin' demon, y'know?
[->]But all they do when they see me is
scream and whimper God's name. They
don't even try to run!
[->]And that ain't no fun at all! The
thrill of the hunt is in the chase!
[END]
16: (Guiding Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403002]There are some who are opposed to the
idea of moving to a new land...
[->]But all it took was the mention of
your name to convince them and stop
their grumbling.
[->]It crossed my mind at such times that
God is a necessary evil to keep the
people in line... 
[END]
103: (Patrolling Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403011]Even if the Monastery wants to prohibit
Literature, once people have the taste
for it, they won't easily give it up.
[->]I hear that the people pretend to
normalcy while concealing the books.
They loan them out to one another...
[->]We are certain of it, but we haven't
proof. And I loathe myself for turning
a suspicious eye on my fellow subjects.
[END]
104: (Patrolling Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]Were I to ask any subject if he had
read Literature, he would respond:
[->]”Of course not, master Samurai, Sir!”
[->]It saddens me... The glorious people,
chosen by God to be part of our
kingdom...
[->]They have learned deceit in order to
indulge their desires...
[END]
107: (Patrolling Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]We considered bringing the pigs along
with us to Tokyo...
[->]But in the end, we had to preserve most
of them in salt and let the people
bring them that way.
[->]They made the ultimate sacrifice for us.
It reminds us how precarious our
situation is.
[->]We must not forget all that. We must
stay humble in the new world...
[END]
110: (Guiding Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403043]There were some men who had planned a
protest movement upon hearing that the
Black Samurai was to be executed.
[->]To a man, they turned out to be covert
supporters of the Black Samurai. We've
rounded them all up, naturally.
[->]But no matter how tight a grip we try
to keep on some things, word of mouth
always slips through our fingers...
[END]
203: (Patrolling Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403011]Abbot Hugo has devised a scheme to
invite the people into Mikado Castle.
[->]While they attend the public execution,
the Samurai are under orders to search
their dwellings.
[->]Abbot Hugo would have we noble Samurai
doing the work of common thieves!
It is preposterous!
[END]
