0: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 46][13 1, 404311]Just 'cause you're a Hunter, that don't
make ya hot shit, capiche?
[->]Even the toughest fighter ain't no
match for the boss' demons.
[END]
1: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 46][13 1, 404311]I heard there's some guy who wears
steel armor... Probably one of them
Hunters.
[->]And here I thought we salvaged pretty
much all the goodies in Tokyo. Wonder
where he found it...
[END]
2: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 46][13 1, 404311]I−I heard from the boys in Shibuya that
they got demons pourin' outta Ichigaya,
one after the other!
[->]Wh−What's Mr. Tayama doing!? He ain't
given us any orders yet...!
[->]If he lets demons loose in Tokyo to do
whatever they want, this city's gonna
go straight to shit...
[END]
3: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 46][13 1, 404311]Oh hey, if it ain't the champ! I always
knew you were somethin', ya know?
[->]I say Tayama's old news! You're the
risin' star in Tokyo!
[END]
4: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 46][13 1, 404311]Oh hey, if it ain't the champ! I always
knew you were somethin', ya know?
[->]I hear there's some wiseguy called the
Demon Lord or somethin'... But you're
the man right now!
[END]
5: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 46][13 1, 404311]If you're willin'... I could call
around, make some arrangements.
Whaddaya say?
[->]C'mon, don't act like ya don't know!
I'm talkin' about ya steppin' up as
the Ashura−kai's new leader!
[END]
6: (Hunter woman) [7a 68][13 1, 403102]If you go south from Ueno, you'll find
some demons called Kelpies by the
riverbed.
[->]They used to live in Shinobazu Pond,
but they got kicked out after losing
a turf dispute with another demon.
[END]
7: (Hunter woman) [7a 68][13 1, 403103]Kelpies aren't the only ones you can
turn to for river crossings.
[->]Sometimes you can hire a ferryman to
help you across a river. Though it
won't be free...
[END]
8: (Hunter woman) [7a 68][13 1, 403103]I hear the Ring of Gaea is pretty
popular out in Ginza...
[->]That's fine for folks who like buddying
up with demons, but a girl like me can't
even stand to bathe in the water there.
[END]
9: (Hunter woman) [7a 68][13 1, 403103]An overall ranking, huh? I bet it's
some stunt of the Association's...
[->]But it seems like everyone's doing it
nowadays. Should I get in on it...?
Hmm...
[END]
10: (Hunter woman) [7a 68][13 1, 403142]I hear the Ring of Gaea's still going
strong in Ginza...
[->]I'm sure the kind of guys who love
buddying up to demons are thrilled
that they're all over Tokyo.
[END]
11: (Hunter woman) [7a 68][13 1, 403103]I hear the Ring of Gaea's still going
strong in Ginza...
[->]Their motto is, ”So long as man roams
the Earth, demons will always be there.”
[->]The fact is, the demons aren't entirely
wiped out... I guess it's a harsh
reality we'll have to live with.
[END]
12: (Thug) [7a 121][13 1, 403021]Y'know what? I really wanna dig in with
some real yakitori and get drunk on
some real beer...
[->]Say, you think the Ashura−kai's hiring?
I could be a receptionist or a collection
officer or whatever shit they want...
[END]
13: (Thug) [7a 121][13 1, 403021]If the rumor about the Ashura−kai
gettin' disbanded is true... What's
that mean for me...?
[->]My whole plan to join up with them,
drink their good hooch, and shack up
with some broads will be for nothing!
[END]
14: (Thug) [7a 121][13 1, 403042]If that rumor about the Ashura−kai is
true, I'll never get to drink their
hooch or screw their broads!
[->]Do they want me to die in this shithole
of an underground district!?
[END]
15: (Thug) [7a 121][13 1, 403002]What the!?  It's the champion! I was
followin' you in the rankings!
[->]That finishin' surge was awesome! The
best! Dude, I love you. No foolin',
I seriously love you, man!
[END]
16: (Thug) [7a 121][13 1, 403002]Hey, champ. I came up with a good idea
for work the other day.
[->]Since that Demon Lord is gone, there'll
be other morons doin' bad stuff, yeah?
[->]So I could go around the city as a
patrolman to warn 'em off.
[->]Of course, I'd charge protection
money... What do you think?
[END]
101: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 46][13 1, 404311]The schmuck who killed those demons in
Shinjuku and Ikebukuro... According to
eyewitnesses, it was the same guy...
[->]Who the hell would have the nerve to
mess around like that on our turf?
[END]
102: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 46][13 1, 404311]I−I heard from the boys in Shibuya that
they got demons pourin' outta Ichigaya,
one after the other!
[->]Wh−What's Mr. Tayama doing!? He ain't
given us any orders yet...!
[->]If he lets demons loose in Tokyo to do
whatever they want, this city's gonna
go straight to shit...
[END]
106: (Hunter woman) [7a 68][13 1, 403102]For some reason, the Kelpies are always
encouraging me to cross the bridge...
[->]I don't, of course. Even if I cross,
what's there for me? The only thing on
the other side is some broken−down base.
[END]
110: (Hunter woman) [7a 68][13 1, 403142]I hear the Ring of Gaea's still going
strong in Ginza...
[->]All those demons coming out from
Ichigaya... And those demon−lovers
are standing there with welcome signs!
[END]
112: (Thug) [7a 121][13 1, 403021]Y'know what? I really wanna dig in with
some real yakitori and get drunk on
some real beer...
[->]I hear you can get real meat in Shinjuku.
That's why I love the Ashura−kai with
all my heart!
[END]
114: (Thug) [7a 121][13 1, 403042]If that rumor about the Ashura−kai is
true, I'll never get to drink their
hooch or screw their broads!
[->]Do they want me to die in this shithole
of an underground district!?
[->]Well, if that ranking shit wasn't as
exciting as it is, I woulda died in
here for real.
[->]I had my eye on that guy called
[Flynn], y'know?
[END]
201: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 46][13 1, 404311]That demon in Shibuya? It was a
National Defense Divinity controlled
by you−know−who.
[->]And this guy cleans its clock! No wonder
Mr. Tayama's taken an interest...
[END]
202: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 46][13 1, 404311]I−I heard from the boys in Shibuya that
they got demons pourin' outta Ichigaya,
one after the other!
[->]Wh−What's Mr. Tayama doing!? He ain't
given us any orders yet...!
[->]M−Maybe I oughtta switch sides... Yeah,
I'll go see what's goin' on in Shinjuku.
[END]
212: (Thug) [7a 121][13 1, 403021]Dude... Listen, man, real meat...
Ueno should get in on that shit...
[->]I'm talkin' about raisin' livestock,
of course! They do that in Shinjuku
National Park too.
[END]
301: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 46][13 1, 404311]Hey, I heard Mr. Tayama went easy
on ya.
[->]That mercy from a man who lives his life
in a world where mercy is a weakness...
It's a rare gift, capiche?
[->]That means he's put his trust in ya.
I wouldn't let him down, if ya know
what I mean.
[END]
302: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 46][13 1, 404311]I−I heard from the boys in Shibuya that
they got demons pourin' outta Ichigaya,
one after the other!
[->]Wh−What's Mr. Tayama doing!? He ain't
given us any orders yet...!
[->]M−Maybe I oughtta switch sides...
[END]
312: (Thug) [7a 121][13 1, 403021]Damn, Ueno sure is the pits. They should
start sellin' Reds here. That'd liven
up the place, no doubt.
[->]Hell, there's plenty of good spots
for it. Like that strip club or the
old Ameya−Yokocho lot.
[END]
401: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 46][13 1, 404311]I knew this day would come someday...
I feel sorry for you, I really do.
[->]'Cause you've forced Mr. Tayama to
summon his demon...
[END]
402: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 46][13 1, 404311]How come Mr. Tayama ain't given us any
orders!? Demons are pourin' out from
Ichigaya as we speak...
[->]Maybe I oughtta switch sides... Who was
that guy at the top of the rankings?
[->]Yeah, [Flynn], him! I better
sweeten him with some bribes while
I can...
[END]
412: (Thug) [7a 121][13 1, 403021]What'll it mean for me if the Ashura−kai
gets whacked...!?
[->]My whole plan to join up with them,
drink their good hooch, and shack up
with some broads will be for nothing!
[END]
