0: (Emaciated man) [7a 59][13 1, 403211]We've never been strong enough to
fight, so I've never tasted demon
meat.
[->]Because of that, we were on the edge
of starvation... but, still, we
managed.
[END]
1: (Emaciated man) [7a 59][13 1, 403212]We starved because we could not get
a supply of demon meat. That's why
we were desperate to rely on God...
[->]Eventually, that turned into us
worshipping Gozutennou.
[END]
2: (Emaciated man) [7a 59][13 1, 403212]Though it was purely for survival,
we have committed a sin that cannot
be forgiven.
[->]We've decided to bear this sin and
continue living.
[END]
3: (Thin−faced woman) [7a 122][13 1, 403323]Huh? ...What did we eat to survive
if we didn't have demon meat?
[->]Th−That's... none of your business!
Leave us alone!
[END]
4: (Thin−faced woman) [7a 122][13 1, 403322]We had cows. That's what we ate
all this time.
[->]Cows... That's right...
We ate beef!
[END]
5: (Thin−faced woman) [7a 122][13 1, 403322]I kept telling myself that it was
beef...
[->]If only I'd been able to do anything
else with the desperation I used in
lying to myself...
[END]
6: (Elderly woman) [7a 65][13 1, 403923]Our lives are the result of
Gozutennou's blessing...
[->]We owe our survival to Gozutennou
sharing his food with us...
[END]
7: (Elderly woman) [7a 65][13 1, 403923]The festivals for Gozutennou begin
with a quiet prayer, then move on
to song and dancing...
[->]And finally, we eat the animal that
we offered to Gozutennou earlier.
[END]
8: (Elderly Woman) [7a 65][13 1, 403923]That long, nightmarish fete is
finally over...
[END]
