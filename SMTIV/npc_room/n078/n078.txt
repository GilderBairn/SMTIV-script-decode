0: (Hunter) [7a 119][13 1, 403001]The Ring of Gaea people rarely leave
their main temple.
[->]But, since they've come to Ikebukuro,
does that mean that woman is going
to make a move as well?

1: (Hunter) [7a 119][13 1, 403001]The Ring of Gaea people rarely leave
their main temple.
[->]But, since they've come to Ikebukuro,
does that mean Yuriko is going to
make a move as well?
[END]
2: (Hunter) [7a 119][13 1, 403001]Someone who actually saw her in
person told me that Yuriko's a
young woman.
[->]So, a young girl leads an organization
like the Ring of Gaea? I wonder what
kind of leader she is.
[END]
3: (Hunter) [7a 119][13 1, 403001]Tayama's sent his men to kill Yuriko
a number of times.
[->]But I hear that she sends the corpses
back, cut into tiny slices and kept
in formaldehyde...
[->]That Yuriko woman's so cold it gives
me chills thinking about her. I'd
never want to get on her bad side.
[END]
4: (Hunter) [7a 68][13 1, 403141]You picked a good time to come.
The Ashura−kai's already been driven
out.
[->]The Ashura−kai uses Reds to tame
demons, and the Ring of Gaea is
openly opposed to them.
[->]If you'd been here when the Ashura−kai
and the Ring of Gaea were going at
it... You would've been in trouble.
[END]
5: (Hunter) [7a 68][13 1, 403141]The people who didn't participate in
the battle against Xi Wangu have left
the city.
[->]They appear quickly, and disappear
without a trace when they go...
[->]They're like some kind of military
strike force.
[END]
6: (Hunter) [7a 68][13 1, 403141]If the Ashura−kai goes on a full−on
assault, the Ring of Gaea will surely
be greatly weakened.
[->]But if that happened, the Yamato
Reactor will be left poorly guarded,
and the Ring of Gaea will take it...
[->]The Ring of Gaea is cautious of
Tayama's demons, and won't throw
themselves into an all−out attack.
[->]Both sides are looking for an opening,
and they're currently at a standstill.
[END]
7: (Hunter) [7a 68][13 1, 403141]It looks like Yuriko's going to go
for a full−on attack on Ichigaya.
[->]She was being so careful and cautious
about Tayama's demons, too...
[->]Could this mean that she's gained
a more powerful ally?
[END]
