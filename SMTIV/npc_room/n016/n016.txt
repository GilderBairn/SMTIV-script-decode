0: (Male demonoid) [7a 167][13 1, 412103]Who the... I haven't seen you around.
You don't look like a demonoid...
[->]Are you a neurisher on the run from
a nearby town? But there's nothing
on top of your head...
[END]
1: (Male demonoid) [7a 167][13 1, 412101]Ever since I became a demonoid, I've
lost track of the news and the net...
[->]I'm sure no one knows what's going on
outside Tokyo.
[->]Since we wrecked the place, there's no
communication technology left. Even the
terrain's different.
[->]But if the demons did kick the angels'
asses, I bet America and China are in
basically the same situation.
[END]
2: (Male neurisher) [7a 105][13 1, 403421]Y−You... Are you here to... eat me...?
W−Well... Just don't do it literally...
please?
[->]I'll try to remember the girl I had a
crush on 25 years ago...
[->]After three minutes, you can pop off
my plug cover, stick in a straw, and
suck away from there...
[END]
3: (Male neurisher) [7a 105][13 1, 403412]It's hell living like this... I wish
I could let go of my emotions...
[->]But that won't help. If I stop feeling,
my brain won't produce the juice.
[->]And there's only one end for a useless
neurisher. Getting eaten alive...
[END]
4: (Male demonoid) [7a 145][13 1, 415202]Neurishers are food for demonoids...
Every neurisher is some demonoid's
property.
[->]So who's your master? If you ain't got
anyone, let me know, and I'll snap
you up.
[END]
5: (Male demonoid) [7a 145][13 1, 415205]Neurishers reflect a demonoid's status.
The more you own, the stronger a
demonoid you are.
[->]So there's fierce competition between
demonoids for ownership of neurishers.
[END]
6: (Male demonoid) [7a 145][13 1, 415100]You guys are headed for Shinjuku, right?
I'll tell you how to get there...
[->]First you leave Kasumigaseki, then head
north. When you get to a crossroads,
go west.
[->]Go along that road to the west, keep on
going past Ichigaya, and you'll see
a meadow...
[END]
7: (Male demonoid) [7a 145][13 1, 415100]I hear you guys are finally headed for
Ichigaya. Is that true? Then you should
go north along the road out of here.
[->]If you've been to Shinjuku, you've
probably seen it already. Yeah, that's
the place.
[->]But Kenji's going to be way stronger
than you're expecting. You better make
sure you're ready, understand?
[END]
8: (Male demonoid) [7a 145][13 1, 415107]Akira's the King of Tokyo, huh? Then
he's got a target on his back...
[->]That guy can talk, but he ain't no
fighter. We've gotta do more to back
him up from now on.
[END]
9: (Female neurisher) [7a 106][13 1, 403501]......
[END]
10: 〉 The woman with a plug implanted in her
head is spacing out...
[END]
11: (Male demonoid) [7a 103][13 1, 415200]This girl isn't producing enough brain
waves anymore... Maybe her emotions
are shot.
[->]Hmm... I could try making her laugh to
get a rise out of her. Or beat her up,
maybe.
[END]
12: (Female neurisher) [7a 106][13 1, 403501]......
[END]
13: 〉 The woman with a plug implanted in her
head is spacing out...
[END]
14: (Male demonoid) [7a 103][13 1, 415209]...No good. She's wasted... She's got
no emotions left, I guess.
[->]Well, nothing for it now but to use the
direct approach. Don't worry, sweetheart.
I won't hurt you... bad...
[END]
15: (Little boy) [7a 32][13 1, 404003]......
[END]
16: (Male demonoid) [7a 103][13 1, 415209]...Huh? That kid ain't mine. He belonged
to this neurisher girl who used to live
here.
[->]No wonder she produced lots of brain
juice... But she left behind some
souvenir, huh?
[END]
17: (Little boy) [7a 32][13 1, 404003]......
[END]
18: (Male demonoid) [7a 103][13 1, 415209]He came from some neurisher girl.
No wonder she produced lots of brain
juice...
[->]When this kid gets old enough to
understand what I'm saying, I should
tell him about his mom...
[->]Shit... Some homework that lazy bitch
left me...
[END]
106: (Male demonoid) [7a 145][13 1, 415108]Geez... I'm getting bored just telling
you that much. Why don't you go find
the rest of the way yourselves?
[END]
108: (Male demonoid) [7a 145][13 1, 415107]Not much has changed since Akira became
the King of Tokyo. It's still anarchy
out here...
[->]One day... Just one day without a
murder, that's all I ask. One peaceful
day...
[END]
