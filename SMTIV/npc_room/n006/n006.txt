0: (Intelligent monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403602]This is the Monastery... a sacred
place where those who serve God gather...
[->]Since you are here, you must be among
we who serve the Lord. Let us help each
other dedicate ourselves to the kingdom.
[END]
1: (Intelligent monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403602]I heard that there was a skirmish
amongst the young Samurai...
[->]These things happen when one is prideful
of the power he possesses. We must be
watchful to keep to our assigned roles.
[END]
2: (Intelligent monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403641]Our role is to study the lost wisdom
and knowledge for the kingdom's sake.
[->]We have already scoured the areas of
Naraku where the code permits the
Samurai to venture...
[->]So you do Abbot Hugo a disservice by
holding a grudge. We are only playing
our parts; that is all.
[END]
3: (Intelligent monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403602]It was Sister Gabby who proposed that
we hold a public execution for the
Black Samurai.
[->]The Sabbaths caused pilgrimages of
the people from village to village...
leading to an exchange of ideas.
[->]Presumptions and hearsay will induce
fear and anxiety. This execution will
dispel it and right the people again.
[->]Small wonder Abbot Hugo calls her the
Right Hand... Her vision is all−
encompassing, as God's would be...
[END]
4: (Intelligent monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403621]The dead have resurrected!? Who would
believe such nonsense!?
[->]It was you Samurai who executed the
Black Samurai, yes?
[->]Do not make me suspect foul play
among you... I should hate to think
she had assistance in her escape...
[END]
5: (Intelligent monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403621]The dead have resurrected!? Who would
believe such nonsense!?
[->]It was you Samurai who executed the
Black Samurai, yes?
[->]Do not make me suspect foul play
among you... I should hate to think
she had assistance in her escape...
[END]
6: (Intelligent monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403622]Abbot Hugo has relayed a message from
our new leaders...
[->]So, that Black Samurai yet lives. She is
an enemy of the state who has demeaned
the people of this kingdom.
[->]My dear young Samurai, you must swiftly
end this Black Samurai's life for the
good of the kingdom!
[END]
7: (Intelligent monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403641]Abbot Hugo has relayed a message from
our new leaders...
[->]The threat of the Black Samurai is
forever passed. The kingdom's peace and
prosperity are secured...
[->]Now... let us hope that the people will
not neglect to revere God...
[END]
8: (Intelligent monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403641]Our years of research shall surely be
useful if we are to lead the people
to Tokyo.
[->]The Monastery concealed itself at first
when the new authorities arrived...
[->]But this strikes me as an ideal chance
to let the people know of our wondrous
deeds.
[END]
9: (Sharp−eyed monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403641]I saw you in the Rite yesterday. I think
congratulations are in order...
[->]Yesterday, you died as a Casualry,
and were born anew as a Samurai.
[->]You are among the Luxurors now, and as
such, it is your duty to be a leader
for the people.
[END]
10: (Sharp−eyed monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403621]There seems to be a strange trend among
the Casualries...
[->]Though those who need to be are already
aware of it. Let us wait and see what
comes of it...
[END]
11: (Sharp−eyed monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403601]Abbot Hugo is attending the all−night
meeting now, together with Commander
Hope and Sister Gabby.
[->]The matter of people turning into
demons is one of national security...
[->]We must ban these Sabbaths and destroy
demons wherever they appear. And, of
course, apprehend the Black Samurai.
[->]There are so many issues which only
Abbot Hugo can judge...
[END]
12: (Sharp−eyed monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403642]Abbot Hugo is resting himself after
the meeting with Sir Hope.
[->]According to Abbot Hugo, he plead with
Sir Hope to take command in Tokyo...
[->]But night upon night of persuasion was
futile, and Sir Hope never agreed.
[END]
13: (Sharp−eyed monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403601]Sister Gabby has gone to the Obelisk
Plaza.
[->]This new trouble is hitting us hard,
and the excitement of the execution
hasn't yet diminished...
[->]I'm sure she merely needed a bit of
fresh air.
[END]
14: (Sharp−eyed monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403621]I've not seen Sister Gabby for some
time.
[->]Usually, Abbot Hugo can be heard crying
out for her as soon as he notices her
absence...
[->]But lately, he holds his tongue, as if
he respects her. Or fears her...
[END]
15: (Sharp−eyed monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403622]Abbot Hugo is very quick on his feet.
He was utterly insistent on gathering
mystic relics until the other day...
[->]Er, no... th−that was a compliment.
He, too, is one of the kingdom's
people, chosen by God...
[->]Oh, please do not breathe a word of
this to the others at Obelisk Plaza!
Thank you...!
[END]
16: (Sharp−eyed monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403641]Abbot Hugo is very quick on his feet.
Until very recently, he held Tokyo in
such disdain...
[->]Er, no... th−that was a compliment.
He, too, is an important member of the
Eastern Kingdom of Mikado...
[->]Oh, please do not breathe a word of
this to the others at Obelisk Plaza!
Thank you...!
[END]
17: (Reserved monk) [7a 43][13 1, 403702]New Samurai are very rare. We don't see
them every year. But this year, we even
have a female recruit...
[->]She comes from a family that has given
us many excellent monks. Of course,
this is a loss for the Monastery...
[->]But I'm sure she will provide beauty and
grace to the man's world of the Samurai
order.
[END]
18: (Reserved monk) [7a 43][13 1, 403742]Isabeau was just visiting us. She
wished to pray before departing...
[->]Though she is young, she has a
laudable soul. May God be with her
wherever she goes...
[END]
19: (Reserved monk) [7a 43][13 1, 403741]Isabeau was just visiting us. She was
seeking flowers to bring to some of
the wounded fellows.
[->]Her concern for her fellows, even while
on leave, is touching... She is a very
kind−hearted girl.
[END]
20: (Reserved monk) [7a 43][13 1, 403702]According to historical documents, there
was indeed a great deal of magic in the
Unclean Ones' country. 
[->]By pursuing the Black Samurai, you will
be a living testament to that history...
[->]Considering that Abbot Hugo granted you
this opportunity, you should be grateful
to him.
[END]
21: (Reserved monk) [7a 43][13 1, 403721]The Black Samurai is from the Unclean
Ones' country... where magic exists...
[->]Do you think that this incident was
caused by the Unclean Ones' magic?
[END]
22: (Reserved monk) [7a 43][13 1, 403722]The Black Samurai is from the Unclean
Ones' country... where magic exists...
[->]Do you think that this incident was
caused by the Unclean Ones' magic?
[END]
23: (Reserved monk) [7a 43][13 1, 403721]I have heard that we are going to devote
fewer of our resources to recovering
mystic relics...
[->]Abbot Hugo will not be pleased, I'm
sure. But such are our new leaders'
orders.
[END]
24: (Reserved monk) [7a 43][13 1, 403721]By the by, I see less of Isabeau lately.
[->]I understand that she is traveling to
many places on the word of Commander
Hope.
[->]It was a shame what happened to
Navarre... And now Jonathan and Walter
are also missing.
[->]I believe that makes you the only fresh
Samurai left in this kingdom...
[END]
25: (Reserved monk) [7a 43][13 1, 403702]Isabeau was just visiting us. She seemed
somewhat happier than before.
[->]It was a shame what happened to
Navarre... And now Jonathan and Walter
are also missing.
[->]I believe that makes you and Isabeau
the only fresh Samurai left in this
kingdom...
[->]But there was nothing insincere about
the gleam in her eyes. She seemed
genuinely hopeful.
[END]
26: (Hugo) [7a 10][13 1, 400703]Damn that Black Samurai... She's been
vexing enough thus far...
[->]Oh, hello. You're cooking up something
with Gabby these days, aren't you?
[->]Do let me know if it's anything
important, won't you?
[END]
27: (Hugo) [7a 10][13 1, 400711]So you've met our new leaders, correct?
...Very well.
[->]We're very busy compiling a history of
our kingdom at the moment.
[->]Of course we will have to include the
exiled king in this history...
[->]It gives me a strange sense of nostalgia.
My thoughts turn to the Unclean Ones'
banishment 1,500 years past...
[END]
28: (Gabby) [7a 11][13 1, 400801]To wear the uniform of the Counter−
Demon Force founded to bring peace,
and instead threaten our safety...
[->]The Black Samurai is a blight upon the
prosperity of this kingdom. You must
contain her evil as quickly as you can.
[END]
29: (Gabby) [7a 11][13 1, 400801]Please mind your step on the way to
Shinjuku National Park.
[->]You must be a savior to the people,
for the kingdom's new millennium.
[END]
109: (Sharp−eyed monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403641]Only a few in the castle are aware that
there are demons within Naraku.
[->]No one would dream that there are demons
just beyond the castle wall...
[->]It is a careful decision on the
Monastery's part to keep our silence.
To let it be known would create panic...
[END]
117: (Reserved monk) [7a 43][13 1, 403702]Isabeau just came to see us. She wanted
to offer her thanks to God for her
success in the training exercises.
[->]Though she is young, she has a
laudable soul. May God be with her
wherever she goes...
[END]
118: (Reserved monk) [7a 43][13 1, 403742]Isabeau was just visiting us. She begged
forgiveness for the foolish deeds
conducted by some of her fellows.
[->]She has a generous spirit that cares
for others... May God be with her
wherever she goes.
[END]
125: (Reserved monk) [7a 43][13 1, 403702]Ah, my dear [Flynn]. I did not
know you were still in the kingdom.
[->]I am going to be sure no one is left
behind in this place before heading
for Tokyo.
[->]I will see you in Shinjuku.
[END]
