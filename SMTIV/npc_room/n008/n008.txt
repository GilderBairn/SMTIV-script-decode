0: (Cheerless woman) [7a 98][13 1, 403312]Whaaat? Beyond the rooftop? How can you
not know there's nothing up there?
[->]I mean, maybe the Angel's Cocoon,
I guess... It abandoned us and
vanished into the sky.
[END]
1: (Cheerless woman) [7a 98][13 1, 403312]Whaaat? Beyond the rooftop? How can you
not know there's been nothing in the
sky for ages?
[->]But if this rooftop you claim to have
seen existed, Tokyo might have been
protected from God's wrath...
[END]
2: (Cheerless woman) [7a 98][13 1, 403341]I heard you're willing to go to Shibuya.
You can't take the overland route,
you know. You have to use a Terminal.
[->]Pretty sure there was a Terminal Room
in Kasumigaseki... I think...
[->]If there was, it would be all locked up.
That's probably where you'd find the
Terminal Room...
[END]
3: (Cheerless woman) [7a 98][13 1, 403312]Oh, so you went to Shibuya, huh?
[->]Let me guess−−you didn't find anything?
Apart from the bodies of people the
demons killed, that is.
[END]
4: (Cheerless woman) [7a 98][13 1, 403312]I wish my family in Shibuya could be
with me to share this...
[->]Huh? You're going to Shibuya? Well, you
can't take the overland route. You have
to use a Terminal.
[->]Pretty sure there was a Terminal Room
in Kasumigaseki... I think...
[->]If there was, it would be all locked up.
That's probably where you'd find the
Terminal Room...
[END]
5: (Taciturn man) [7a 97][13 1, 403212]The Counter−Demon Force got wiped out
25 years ago. You guys wouldn't have
even been born then.
[->]Question is... Why do you have the
Demon Summoning Program? You weren't
in the Force...
[->]Anyway, we'll let Akira decide what
to do with you.
[END]
6: Testers, if you see this text, plz
notify Yu Namba. This is not supposed
to show.
[END]
7: (Taciturn man) [7a 97][13 1, 403212]God used angels to pick out the ones
who would be useful to Him and loaded
them in that cocoon.
[->]Anyone who didn't qualify, He tried to
burn out through the wrath of God.
[->]God doesn't want us around anymore.
See, we know what He's really like...
[->]That's why He sent that horrible monster
Pluto into Tokyo.
[END]
8: (Taciturn man) [7a 97][13 1, 403203]God really did abandon us. And then He
tried to burn us all up!
[->]But if you guys really are the Messiahs...
Does that mean God hasn't forgotten us?
[END]
9: (Throaty woman) [7a 98][13 1, 403322]Ohhhh... how I hate Pluto. But nothing
can dent that monstrosity...
[->]Pluto took away my love... my future...
My hatred for him is inexpressible...
[END]
10: Testers, if you see this text, plz
notify Yu Namba. This is not supposed
to show.
[END]
11: (Throaty woman) [7a 98][13 1, 403322]Someone over there started to call the
monster, ”Pluto the Tormentor”...
[->]After a god of the netherworld in some
country's mythology...
[->]It calls us into the netherworld... Ah...
How I hate Pluto...!
[END]
12: (Throaty woman) [7a 98][13 1, 403341]I've been crying so long, blaming it
all on Pluto... I've neglected to do
my part here.
[->]But I shouldn't let them spoil me
anymore. Haha... I hope there's still
some work in these muscles!
[END]
13: (Dazed man) [7a 97][13 1, 403222]......
[END]
14: You can sense him staring at you in
fear through the goggles...
[END]
15: (Dazed man) [7a 97][13 1, 403212]Did you guys say you came from the
military camp? Then you saw it on your
way to Shinjuku?
[->]I mean Camp Ichigaya to the east. But
even if you go, you won't get anywhere.
[->]There's a Domain thrown over it. Don't
ask me who or what did it.
[END]
16: (Dazed man) [7a 97][13 1, 403212]Finally, Pluto is gone. This is a new
beginning for us.
[->]...But do we have to get started now?
[END]
17: (Dazed man) [7a 97][13 1, 403202]Did you guys say you came from the
military camp? Then you saw it on your
way to Shinjuku?
[->]I mean Camp Ichigaya to the east. Since
the Domain's faded, you can get in
there now...
[->]But all you'd find there is an old
reactor called the Yamato.
[END]
18: (Dazed man) [7a 97][13 1, 403202]Did you guys say you came from the
military camp!? You must have nerves
of steel...
[->]Didn't Akira tell you to stay away from
the Ichigaya region?
[->]I hear there's an old reactor there
called the Yamato where all the demons
are coming from...
[END]
108: (Taciturn man) [7a 97][13 1, 403203]God really did abandon us. And then He
tried to burn us all up!
[->]But if you guys really are the Messiahs...
Does that mean God hasn't forgotten us?
[->]Well, it don't matter. My mind's made
up. I'm going to restore Tokyo along
with Akira.
[END]
112: (Throaty woman) [7a 98][13 1, 403341]I've been avoiding all my chores,
blaming everything on Pluto... I guess
this is the price I pay.
[->]You know... my nerves aren't really
responding anymore... The poison did
more damage than I thought.
[->]But don't tell the others, okay?
I don't want them to pity me...
[END]
208: (Taciturn man) [7a 97][13 1, 403203]I don't get God... First He burns up
Tokyo, then He sends us Messiahs.
[->]How can you trust a schizo dude
like Him?
[->]Anyway, my mind's made up. I'm going
to restore Tokyo along with Akira.
[END]
