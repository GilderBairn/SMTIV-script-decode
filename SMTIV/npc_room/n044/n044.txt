headquarters. Tayama should be there.
[->]From street punk to Hills elite, huh?
Talk about moving up in the world...

1: (Hunter woman) [7a 68][13 1, 403123]Camp Ichigaya is dangerous. You won't
catch me going near there!
[->]There's always Ashura−kai thugs standing
guard... And not just that, I hear the
place is filled with demons.
[END]
2: (Hunter woman) [7a 68][13 1, 403103]Hey, you hear what happened to Tayama?
He was found dead in Ichigaya...
[->]Does that mean his room in Roppongi
is up for grabs?

100: (Hunter woman) [7a 70][13 1, 403141]Club Milton used to be the way station
for distributing Reds.
[->]But Koga Saburo seized the place, and
then Peallaidh started acting up in
Ueno...
[->]Tayama was stuck in Roppongi, too busy
to deal with it, and couldn't take any
effective action.
[->]But now he's got the distribution
system up and running again. He doesn't
need to hold back on Yuriko anymore.
