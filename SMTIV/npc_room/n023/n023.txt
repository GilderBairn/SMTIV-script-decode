0: (Grimacing man) [7a 59][13 1, 403203]I haven't seen you guys before. Are you
Hunters from somewhere else?
[->]But the bridge is down, and the Kelpies
are in no mood to negotiate...
[->]So that leaves... you came from the
Sky Tower? Nah, there's no way.
[END]
1: (Grimacing man) [7a 59][13 1, 403212]What...? You have access to the
Ryogoku area? So does that mean you
can get to Shinjuku?
[->]I hear that place is full of buried
treasure, but it's very dangerous to
stick around for long.
[->]...Though I guess it was always like
that, huh?
[END]
2: (Grimacing man) [7a 59][13 1, 403212]Even though the demons occupying here
and there around Tokyo are gone...
[->]It suddenly seems like there are more
demons around. Reminds me of when the
ceiling first appeared...
[END]
3: (Grimacing man) [7a 59][13 1, 403212]It suddenly seems like there are more
demons around. Reminds me of when the
ceiling first appeared...
[->]And all those stupid Hunters can do
is fool around with their stupid
tournament...
[->]Although... that guy [Flynn]...
He's really moving up the ranks,
isn't he?
[->]I don't care much about the scoreboard,
but I keep hearing his name.
[END]
4: (Grimacing man) [7a 59][13 1, 403213]It suddenly seems like there are more
demons around. Reminds me of when the
ceiling first appeared...
[->]But it's different this time, 'cause we
got the champion on our side!
[END]
5: (Grimacing man) [7a 59][13 1, 403233]You know... I have this recurring dream
lately... It's about Tokyo before the
ceiling appeared.
[->]I wish it was one of those prophetic
dreams, but... Haha, nah. I shouldn't
get my hopes up.
[END]
6: (Fragile−looking man) [7a 60][13 1, 403403]There's no safe place in Tokyo. Walk
outside, and all you'll see are demons.
[->]That's where these safe underground
districts really come in handy. We
have the Ashura−kai to thank.
[END]
7: (Fragile−looking man) [7a 60][13 1, 403402]H−Hey, I hear there are more demons
outside. Is that true? Wh−What about
inside the underground districts?
[->]We're safe, right? Mr. Tayama will take
care of us, yeah? I'm sure he'll work
out a deal to protect us...
[END]
8: (Fragile−looking man) [7a 60][13 1, 403402]H−Hey, I hear there are more demons
outside. Is that true? Wh−What about
inside the underground districts?
[->]But we've got you with us! You'll work
something out with the demons, right?
[->]Also, we'll need someone to negotiate
with those angels coming down from up
above the ceiling...
[END]
9: (Fragile−looking man) [7a 60][13 1, 403402]I haven't been outside the underground
district for days since I heard there
were more demons out there...
[->]So I finally go outside and the first
thing I hear is the Demon Lord's dead!
Or was that just my wishful thinking...
[END]
100: (Grimacing man) [7a 59][13 1, 403203]What!? You struck a bargain with the
Kelpies? So you can actually get to
Kasumigaseki...?
[->]Well, that bummer of a place used to be
a government district. You won't find
an Association or any shops there...
[->]But the Ashura−kai's keeping a tight
lid on it for some reason. It's not as
if anyone would want to go, though...
[END]
101: (Grimacing man) [7a 59][13 1, 403212]What? You can actually go to Ryogoku
now? That means we can get to Ikebukuro
too, huh...
[->]I dunno, though, I've heard some shady
rumors about that place. Should I go?
[END]
102: (Grimacing man) [7a 59][13 1, 403212]It suddenly seems like there are more
demons around. Reminds me of when the
ceiling first appeared...
[->]What're those stupid Hunters doing,
fooling around with a tournament at
a time like this?
[END]
106: (Fragile−looking man) [7a 60][13 1, 403403]The demon in Shinobazu Pond was bad,
sure, but the one in Shinjuku National
Park is a real terror.
[->]But you'll be safe if you stay in the
underground districts. Good thing we
have the Ashura−kai, I guess.
[END]
107: (Fragile−looking man) [7a 60][13 1, 403402]H−Hey, I hear there are more demons
outside. Is that true? Wh−What about
inside the underground districts?
[->]We're safe, right? Mr. Tayama will take
care of us, yeah? I'm sure he'll work
out a deal to protect us...
[->]O−Or... maybe that [Flynn] guy
can take care of all the demons in
Tokyo. You think...?
[END]
108: (Fragile−looking man) [7a 60][13 1, 403402]H−Hey, I hear there are more demons
outside. Is that true? Wh−What about
inside the underground districts?
[->]But we've got you with us! You'll work
something out with the demons, right?
[->]Oh, and can you get rid of that Demon
Lord too? I don't know much about him,
but he sounds bad...
[END]
201: (Grimacing man) [7a 59][13 1, 403212]Now we can get to the Ryogoku area...
And not only that, but the west side
of Shinjuku, too...
[->]You know, little by little, it's getting
easier to live in Tokyo.
[END]
206: (Fragile−looking man) [7a 60][13 1, 403403]The demon in Shinobazu Pond was bad,
sure, but the one in Shibuya Park is
a real terror.
[->]But you'll be safe if you stay in the
underground districts. Good thing we
have the Ashura−kai, I guess.
[END]
301: (Grimacing man) [7a 59][13 1, 403212]I heard the demons who were terrorizing
Shibuya are history.
[->]You know, little by little, it's getting
easier to live in Tokyo.
[END]
306: (Fragile−looking man) [7a 60][13 1, 403403]The demon in Shinobazu Pond was bad,
sure, but those Ring of Gaea people
are the real terrors.
[->]But you'll be safe if you stay in the
underground districts. Good thing we
have the Ashura−kai, I guess.
[END]
401: (Grimacing man) [7a 59][13 1, 403212]Hey, you know about that demon that was
always meditating in Midtown?
[->]I heard someone took him out. Not that
I got any business in Midtown, but...
[->]The freer we are to get around Tokyo,
the more it feels like its old self...
You know, before the ceiling.
[END]
406: (Fragile−looking man) [7a 60][13 1, 403403]There are some nasty rumors about the
Ashura−kai going around, but we still
owe them a lot...
[->]They're the ones who negotiated these
safe underground districts with the
demons.
[->]Who else could have done it, I ask
you? Only Mr. Tayama could have pulled
it off.
[END]
501: (Grimacing man) [7a 59][13 1, 403212]I keep hearing about demons in charge
of places around Tokyo getting snuffed
right and left.
[->]The freer we are to get around Tokyo,
the more it feels like its old self...
You know, before the ceiling.
[->]The only places we can't reach now are
Toyosu and the Tennozu Shelter...
[->]Oh, and Ichigaya.
[END]
506: (Fragile−looking man) [7a 60][13 1, 403402]There are some nasty rumors about the
Ashura−kai going around, but we still

[->]That's why I support the Ashura−kai
one hundred percent!
