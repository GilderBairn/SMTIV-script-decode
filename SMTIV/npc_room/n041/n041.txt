0: (Easygoing man) [7a 120][13 1, 403403]What!? You can't buy Reds from the
Ashura−kai anymore? Then I'm through
supporting those dickbags!
[->]So, what, should I just go to Ginza?
I bet the Ashura−kai can't boss us
around there.
[END]
1: (Easygoing man) [7a 120][13 1, 403403]I hear the Ashura−kai crushed the
Ring of Gaea.
[->]So I guess that means Tokyo's now
officially under Ashura−kai control.
[END]
2: (Easygoing man) [7a 120][13 1, 403421]I saw a girl walking towards Ichigaya.
She was a cutie, carrying a sword...
[->]Now I know Tokyo's in a mess, but boys
will be boys, right? So I called out
to her.
[->]She told me she was going somewhere to
meet someone she's been expecting. Guess
I got the cold shoulder...
[END]
3: (Easygoing man) [7a 120][13 1, 403402]That Samurai from the world above...
[Flynn]. The one who's ranked in
the top 3.
[->]He's you, ain't he? Man, you rock!
I'm your number one fan!
[END]
4: (Easygoing man) [7a 120][13 1, 403402]Demons are gonna eat us all anyway,
right? Well, in that case...
[->]I wanna die in Shinjuku where that cute
girl in the school uniform hangs out...
You think she really is a schoolgirl?
[->]Actually, though, these days I'd wanna
meet the champion more than her...
[END]
5: (Easygoing man) [7a 120][13 1, 403441]You rock, champion! Way to stop those
angels in their tracks!
[->]I'm sure the demons will be no sweat
for you either, right? We're all
counting on you, champion!
[END]
6: (Easygoing man) [7a 120][13 1, 403441]So I heard this rumor... apparently you
can see the sun rise in Tokyo?
[->]I thought I'd never see that happen
again... and speaking of things I
thought I'd never see again...
[->]That cute girl in the school uniform...
Do you think she's the real deal?
I wonder if she's still in Shinjuku...
[END]
7: (Worried woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403312]H−Hey, why did the Ashura−kai stop
selling Reds?
[->]Without those, I can't even go outside
for a stroll...
[END]
8: (Worried woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403312]Ashura−kai is planning to raise the
price of Reds! What the hell are they
thinking!?
[->]There still are so many demons in Tokyo!
[->]W−Without the Reds, I can't take so
much as one step outside...!
[END]
9: (Worried woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403302]The Ashura−kai plans to raise the price
of Reds because they've hit a snag
getting the ingredients...
[->]It's making me think about counting
on that [Flynn] guy as a last
resort.
[->]If he can kill all the demons, we won't
have to spend a fortune on Reds, right?
[END]
10: (Worried woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403303]The Ashura−kai is going to discontinue
the Reds!? What the hell are they
thinking...?
[->]W−Without the Reds, I can't take so
much as one step outside...! Or...
[->]Maybe we don't need Reds in Tokyo
anymore...?
[END]
11: (Hunter man) [7a 67][13 1, 403042]I'm sure the Ashura−kai WANTS to keep
selling Reds. But that demon's making
it impossible.
[->]The Ashura−kai hired a bunch of tough
guys to take him out, but they all got
snuffed in seconds.
[END]
12: (Hunter man) [7a 67][13 1, 403021]I know it's too late now... but if I'd
seen this coming, I'd have trained more
instead of relying on the Reds.
[->]Koga Saburo and Tenkai tried to stop
us from using them...
[->]Maybe they saw that it was making us
weaker as a species, and trying to
warn us in their own way.
[END]
13: (ハンターの男) [7a 67][13 1, 403002][総合/そうごう]ランキングが[盛/も]り[上/あ]がれば
この[東京/とうきょう]に[活気/かっき]が[戻/もど]ってくるはず…
[->][商会/しょうかい]は そう[考/かんが]えたんだろう?
あいつらも[粋/いき]な[所/ところ]があるじゃないか
[END]
14: (Hunter man) [7a 67][13 1, 403002]I became a Hunter to protect people...
I shouldn't have done nothing...
[->]Now that I'm racing everyone to the
top of the scoreboard, I'm remembering
how it used to feel...
[END]
15: (Hunter man) [7a 67][13 1, 403042]Demons are definitely a major threat
to us. But they taught us something,
too...
[->]The ones like Koga Saburo and Tenkai
warned us not to use Reds, not only
because we'd become demons...
[->]But also because relying on them too
much would make us weak as a species.
[END]
100: (Easygoing man) [7a 120][13 1, 403403]Well, I got my hands on some Reds...
Should I start supporting the Ashura−kai
again?
[->]I thought about going down to Ginza...
But that can wait for now.
[END]
101: (Easygoing man) [7a 120][13 1, 403421]Did the Ring of Gaea seriously attack
the Ashura−kai!?
[->]Boy, this is the big one, ain't it!?
No way I'm missing out!
[END]
102: (Easygoing man) [7a 120][13 1, 403421]Demons are gonna eat us all anyway,
right? Well, in that case...
[->]I wanna die in Shinjuku where that cute
girl in the school uniform hangs out...
You think she really is a schoolgirl?
[->]Hang on, though... That's strange.
For some reason, I can't remember
her face...
[END]
107: (Worried woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403312]H−Hey, the Ashura−kai started selling
Reds again.
[->]They told me their old delivery route
got attacked by Hunters and they needed
to set up a new one.
[->]But hey, now I don't have to worry about
demon attacks!
[END]
108: (Worried woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403312]How can the Ashura−kai even think about
raising the price of Reds at a time
like this!?
[->]I hear some demon moved in and they're
having a lot of trouble getting the
ingredients they need now...
[->]Should I count on that [Flynn]
guy as a last resort?
[->]If he can kill all the demons, we won't
have to spend a fortune on Reds, right?
[END]
111: (Hunter man) [7a 67][13 1, 403042]What was his name...? Koga Saburo,
was it? He's no ordinary demon who
just targets random humans...
[->]He was singling out anyone who tried
to get Reds. I'm not sure, but...
[->]Maybe he knew that eating Reds turns
humans into demons, so he was trying
to protect us?
[END]
200: (Easygoing man) [7a 120][13 1, 403403]Hey, have you seen a cute girl in a
school uniform? Do you think she's
the real deal!?
[->]Schoolgirls were commonplace in the
old Tokyo... but they're practically
extinct now.
[END]
207: (Worried woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403312]H−Hey, I heard the Ashura−kai would give
us a discount on Reds...
[->]They said they got a ton of ingredients
for them in Ikebukuro. I heard that
directly from them.
[->]I wonder what goes into these things,
anyway... Oh well. Point is, I don't
have to worry about demon attacks now!
[END]
211: (Hunter man) [7a 67][13 1, 403042]What was his name...? Tenkai, was it?
He's no ordinary demon who just targets
random humans...
[->]He was singling out anyone who tried
to get Reds. I'm not sure, but...
[->]Maybe he knew that eating Reds turns
humans into demons, so he was trying
to protect us?
[END]
300: (Easygoing man) [7a 120][13 1, 403403]I heard Yuriko declared war against
Tayama. Is that right?
[->]Well, they can have fun with that.
As long as they don't hurt any
innocents, I mean.
[END]
307: (Worried woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403312]Whatever happened to the discount on
Reds those Ashura−kai people promised...?
[->]They told me they found a big supply
of ingredients for them in Ikebukuro...
[->]Th−This is a big problem! I can't even
go outside without Reds!
[END]
311: (Hunter man) [7a 67][13 1, 403042]Both Koga Saburo and Tenkai were trying
to protect us from the Reds...
[->]I'm sure when the Ashura−kai and Ring
of Gaea clash, their demons will join
in the fight...
[->]Come to think of it, demons can be
powerful allies of mankind if you use
them right...
[END]
