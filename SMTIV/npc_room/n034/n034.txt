0: (Fujiwara) [7a 18][13 1, 401301]If you want to visit the underground
part of Roppongi, head for Midtown.
[->]If you're leaving from Shinjuku, go to
the Hills building in Roppongi via
Shibuya. You know the Hills, right?
[->]The Midtown entrance is a bit north
from there.
[END]
1: (Fujiwara) [7a 18][13 1, 401302]Hmm... So your superiors turned down
our request.
[->]Well, we do appreciate that you tried.
I'm sorry if it caused you any grief
with your higher−ups.
[->]We almost died in the Eastern Kingdom
of Mikado... Let's consider it a silver
lining that we get to die in Tokyo.
[END]
2: (Fujiwara) [7a 18][13 1, 401323]Uhm... Sorry, I overreacted a little.
Kinda childish of me...
[->]Though I do consider myself still young
at heart! But putting such a burden on
young guys like you... I'm getting old.
[->]We almost died in the Eastern Kingdom
of Mikado... Let's consider it a silver
lining that we get to die in Tokyo.
[END]
3: (Fujiwara) [7a 18][13 1, 401314]A long time ago... Before the angels
kicked us out of the Eastern Kingdom
of Mikado...
[->]We didn't know how to farm the land,
so we had to find a way to survive.
[->]So we came up with a business to
deliver the water from the lake to
people's houses.
[->]Soon, we started to offer alcohol too.
That attracted more customers, and our
supply depot turned into a tavern...
[->]Skins reminded me of the old days
there...
[END]
4: (Fujiwara) [7a 18][13 1, 401311]About 20 years ago, I think, I met this
little boy at Shinjuku National Park...
[->]For some reason, the kid had a demon
summoning program on him.
[->]He said he was going to rescue his big
sis from the angels. And he swore he'd
go above the ceiling someday to do it.
[->]It was a childish idea, but it really
threw me. Go above the ceiling...? I
would never have thought of it!
[->]He was a special kid, that one...
What was his name again... Oh yeah,
I think he called himself Akira...
[END]
5: (Fujiwara) [7a 18][13 1, 401311]If the bedrock is removed, Tokyo will
see the sunlight and blue skies once
again...
[->]The moment everyone's been dreaming of
for so long is right around the corner.
[->]I have to ask you to see this through to
the very end... Please give us our Tokyo
back.
[END]
6: (Skins) [7a 19][13 1, 401402]The demon Tayama stationed in Midtown
is one of the National Defense
Divinities.
[->]...Don't go fight that thing unless
you're ready. If you're not, your face
will look even worse than mine...
[END]
7: (Skins) [7a 19][13 1, 401403]Who? Hikaru...? A young girl wearing
a school uniform?
[->]You mean that girl Isabeau you were
traveling with, right? No?
[->]Hikaru... Hikaru... Hmm. Sorry, neither
of us have heard of anyone by that
name before...
[END]
8: (Skins) [7a 19][13 1, 401402]Who? Hikaru...? A young girl wearing
a school uniform?
[->]You mean that girl Isabeau you were
traveling with, right? No?
[->]Hikaru... Hikaru... Hmm. Sorry, neither
of us have heard of anyone by that
name before...
[END]
9: (Skins) [7a 149][13 1, 401401]Back when I was still in my prime, there
was a girl I used to see often while
I was out on missions...
[->]A little girl playing with a wheel...
[->]I haven't seen her in a long time, but
I'm strangely certain that she's still
alive somewhere...
[->]Ah, sorry to bother you. I'm still
counting on you about Masakado.
[->]If you unsheathe that sword in front
of the huge rock in Ginza, you'll see
what I mean...
[END]
10: (Skins) [7a 149][13 1, 401405]If you think about it, you'll find that
human history is one selfish decision
after another.
[->]He appears in the middle of Ginza and
they team up to seal him away at
all costs...
[->]Then they learn that Tokyo is in danger
and they resurrect him because they need
his help...
[->]If I was the guardian of Tokyo, I'd have
already given up on humans.
[END]
11: (Skins) [7a 149][13 1, 401404]I never realized how delicious sake
would be when there's no worries about
tomorrow.
[->]You did good, [Flynn]...
I knew you were that boy from 25
years ago.
[->]...Nah, forget I said that. I'm sure
you'll be walking your own path.
[END]
12: (Hikaru) [7a 20][13 1, 401204]You guys are just as good as I thought
you'd be.
[->]You've met Tayama, Yuriko, and even
Fujiwara...
[->]And you're still safe and sound!
[END]
13: (Isabeau) [7a 5][13 1, 400302][Flynn], do you recall the manga
I was reading?
[->]Fujiwara kindly lent me the rest of
the issues that I might finish the
story.
[->]The story's ”Casualries” defeated the
”Luxurors”...
[->]And went on to create a new country.
That was the conclusion...
[->]I was startled to learn that it was
based upon true events.
[->]Man has been killing one another for
thousands of years...
[->]I wonder if we will further the sad
cycle of man's history...
[END]
14: (Hugo) [7a 10][13 1, 400704]I wonder how many wines are buried in
the vastness of Tokyo...
[->]I think I could do worse than to spend
my remaining years as a wine researcher...
[END]
15: (K) [7a 22][13 1, 405010]Since the demons are not yet eliminated,
we Samurai still have work to do.
[->]It seems I'll have to relocate K's Tavern
to Tokyo after all...
[->]First, we must adapt to the environment
there. That done, I'll go and find a
nice spot...
[END]
100: (Fujiwara) [7a 18][13 1, 401301]The Japanese Defence Agency used to be
in Midtown.
[->]If you consider the Reds to be Tokyo's
new defense system, it's almost
appropriate... But not really.
[->]If Tayama picked that spot out of some
kind of poetic justice, he's got a
weird sense of humor.
[END]
103: (Fujiwara) [7a 18][13 1, 401314]Doesn't the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado
have anything like our Associaton?
[->]When we lived in Mikado, we didn't have
anything to do for fun. So we came up
with a hobby... gambling.
[->]At the tavern, we'd place bets on
drinking contests.
[->]Whoever won got a prize. Soon, we
started keeping a ranking board to
keep track of past challenges...
[->]Frankly, this Association here has its
origins in that game. You might call it
a reverse import.
[END]
106: (Skins) [7a 19][13 1, 401402]So you beat Tenkai...
[->]Tenkai was a god sworn to defend his
nation... And you Samurai are trained
to uphold your country's peace...
[->]Both of you are patriots, but there
you were, crossing swords to do what's
right. Pretty ironic...
[END]
109: (Skins) [7a 149][13 1, 401401]Back when I was still in my prime, there
was a girl I used to see often while
I was out on missions...
[->]A little girl playing with a wheel...
[->]I haven't seen her in a long time, but
I'm strangely certain that she's still
alive somewhere...
[END]
112: (Hikaru) [7a 20][13 1, 401204]I had my eyes on you for a long time,
you know?
[->]Even before you were born. Our meeting
was... fated.
[->]The question is... if I said that with
a straight face, would you be glad?
Ahahaha!
[END]
200: (Fujiwara) [7a 18][13 1, 401301]About that idea of telling your
superiors about us...
[->]I know it'll be a tough job, convincing
those guys of our idea.
[->]But we're giving you people some very
valuable information.
[->]I'm counting on their... generous spirit
to repay that kindness.
[END]
206: (Skins) [7a 19][13 1, 401402]Tayama controls the National Defense
Divinities.
[->]As enemies, they're terrible opponents.
But as allies...
[->]...Forget I said anything. I'm too old
to be dreaming impossible dreams...
[END]
212: (Hikaru) [7a 20][13 1, 401204]I've got something important to go do...
So this might be our last meeting.
[->]But if you keep me in your heart,
we'll see each other again...
[->]The question is... if I said that with
a straight face, would you be glad?
Ahahaha!
[END]
