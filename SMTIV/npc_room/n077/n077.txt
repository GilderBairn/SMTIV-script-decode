0: (Ring of Gaea Member) [7a 51][13 1, 404311]We have chosen that we would fight
with our lives to uphold our ideals.
[->]Those are the teachings of our
sublime leader, Lady Yuriko.

1: (Ring of Gaea Member) [7a 54][13 1, 404403]It appears that Kaga volunteered for
the task of bringing Ikebukuro back
under human control.
[->]I heard that she used to live in
Ikebukuro when she was young.
[->]The Ashura−kai pressed Kaga's parents
to give her up to be raised by them.
[->]But, with her parents' help, Kaga
escaped Ikebukuro and reached the
temple of the Ring of Gaea.
[->]Now that she has an opportunity to
crush the Ashura−kai, she has been
given a chance for revenge...
[END]
2: (Ring of Gaea Member) [7a 54][13 1, 404411]...The Ashura−kai? Those swine that
prey on the weak and serve only
to enrich themselves?
[->]...Though, I must say that those who
do the Ashura−kai's bidding and
keep underground are the same.
