0: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 51][13 1, 404302]The Ring of Gaea recommends that
those who yearn for power allow
themselves to always want more.
[->]”If you truly want, it shall be
given.” Those are Lady Yuriko's words.
[END]
1: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 51][13 1, 404302]So, even Lady Yuriko, who was praised
as the witch of the night, could not
stand against the sons of God...
[->]But, not even God's glory will make
us bow before Him.
[->]Yes, indeed. You and your God will
never have a complete victory.
[END]
2: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 51][13 1, 404302]Both children of carnage are with
the witch of the night. Now there is
nothing to fear.
[->]That goes for the demons of the
Counter−Demon Force, now under the
control of Tayama...
[->]We need not fear even the National
Defense Deities!
[END]
3: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 51][13 1, 404302]Not even the warrior of light, with
God's own chariot can make us submit.
[->]Our belief in power cannot be crushed
without the use of force. Even then,
doing so does not deny our beliefs.
[->]That's right. There will be no
complete victory for you and your
God...
[END]
4: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 51][13 1, 404302]The Demon Lord has informed us that
the dogs of Tokyo will strike upon
the city.
[->]If they are going to try to use force
against us, then we will crash down
upon them with even more power.
[->]It is time to put to use all the
strength that I have been training
for all this time...
[END]
5: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 51][13 1, 404302]You hold power that surpasses even
the Demon Lord's... The people of
Tokyo bow to you.
[->]This only further proves that our
belief that only the strong should
rule is correct. Ha...
[->]Hahahahahaha...!
[END]
6: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 54][13 1, 404401]Ah, I remember you. It seems you've
been very active in Ikebukuro.
[->]It's unfortunate what happened to
Kaga, but I have no sympathy for her.
She died because she was weak.

14: (Hunter man) [7a 67][13 1, 403002]...I'm surprised.
Am I really in Tokyo right now...?
[->]There isn't a single Ashura−kai
member in sight, and people are
openly badmouthing Tayama...
[->]Most of all, to think that humans
and demons are living together in
the same space...
[END]
15: (Hunter man) [7a 67][13 1, 403002]...The Ring of Gaea guys are saying
something about Yuriko.
[->]It started immediately after you guys
came back from Tsukiji Hongwanji.
D−Don't tell me, did you guys−−!?
[END]
16: (Hunter man) [7a 67][13 1, 403002]The Ring of Gaea guys seem ecstatic
for some reason.
[->]It started immediately after you guys
came back from Tsukiji Hongwanji.
What did you guys do...?
[END]
17: (Hunter man) [7a 67][13 1, 403012]It seems the Ring of Gaea is looking
forward to this nightmare when demons
will pour into Tokyo...
[->]It's not like they're just acting very
tough about it. Are they really
humans like us?
[END]
18: (Hunter man) [7a 67][13 1, 403012]I got called over by the Association's
bartender a moment ago. It looks like
they're doing some kind of tournament?
[->]Seriously, why in the middle of an
emergency like this? He's one hell
of a salesman.
[END]
19: (Hunter man) [7a 67][13 1, 403002]Each city's Association must've made
a ton of money off that Hunter
Championship thing.
[->]They must take hope from growing
a business, even in a place like
this.
[END]
20: (Hunter man) [7a 67][13 1, 403002]Being a Hunter seems to be a popular
occupation with the young ones.
[->]I mean, I'm a Hunter myself.
It's not that I don't like it...
[->]But, I just feel... that it'd be
better if we weren't in a situation
where Hunters had to exist.
[END]
21: (Confident woman) [7a 80][13 1, 404401]How could a frail woman like me come
all this way?
[->]Well, not even the Ring of Gaea
members can resist my feminine
charms.
[->]But I'm nothing compared to Lady
Yuriko, though...
[END]
24: (Confident woman) [7a 80][13 1, 404431]I've thought back on Lady Yuriko's
beauty, and I've reached a conclusion.
[->]Strength isn't all about muscular
power. Looking at me, don't you
agree? Femininity is real strength.
[->]Men may be the ones that move this
world, but any man can be controlled
by a woman. That is the real power.
[END]
25: (Confident woman) [7a 80][13 1, 416100]So, a champion has been born among
the common folk?
[->]Well, then, since I've made it this
far on my own charms...
[->]I must be the champion of women.
[END]
26: (Confident woman) [7a 80][13 1, 416100]So, a champion has been born among
the common folk?
[->]Well, then, since I've made it this

[->]I must be the champion of women.
[END]
100: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 51][13 1, 404302]So you passed the entrance exam.
You are now a member of the Ring
of Gaea...
[->]If you yearn for power, then you
should always be looking for more.
That is what Lady Yuriko advises.
[END]
104: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 51][13 1, 404302]No matter what the result of this
battle of Armageddon between God and
the demons is...
[->]Our belief in the right of the strong
to rule will never wither!
[->]Even if I lose my limbs and must
live in the mud, I will survive...!
[END]
117: (Hunter man) [7a 67][13 1, 403012]I got called over by the Association's
bartender a moment ago. Something
about some kind of ”event”...
[->]Seriously, why in the middle of an
emergency like this? He's one hell
of a salesman.
[END]
200: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 51][13 1, 404302]Sons of God, domesticated in your
pens above the Firmament... You are
too late.
[->]The prophesied ”child of carnage”
has already been drawn to our cause.
[->]Your objective here must be Lady
Yuriko. Hahaha! Go on, then, and
she will destroy you utterly.
[END]
204: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 51][13 1, 404302]It is an impossibility, but even if
God were to win this battle of
Armageddon...
[->]Our belief in the right of the strong
to rule will never wither!
[->]Even if I lose my limbs and must
live in the mud, I will survive...!
[END]
300: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 51][13 1, 404302]Ah, you've come. You are the ”child
of carnage,” as prophesied by
Lady Yuriko.
[->]Now, Lady Yuriko awaits you.
Hurry and meet with her.
[END]
304: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 51][13 1, 404302]The one who gained the power of the
Demon Lord is a fellow member... He
is the foretold ”child of carnage.”
[->]This only further proves that our
belief that only the strong should
rule is correct.
[->]Even if Tokyo were to be taken over
by demons, I will survive!
[END]
