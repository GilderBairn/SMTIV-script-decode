0: (Quiet man) [7a 45][13 1, 403603]Ah, are you lost? This is a residential
area for we Luxurors.
[->]Of all the lands of the Eastern Kingdom
of Mikado, we Luxurors only live inside
this castle.
[->]I won't forbid you to come here exactly,
but... I would certainly prefer you to
keep to the town's unwritten rules.
[END]
1: (Quiet man) [7a 45][13 1, 403641]I hear tell that there is a stranger
making appearances in the Casualry
District...
[->]No matter. So long as this stranger
doesn't disturb the peace and keeps clear
of our district, I don't mind at all.
[END]
2: (Quiet man) [7a 45][13 1, 403642]I hear tell that the Black Samurai was
making regular visits to the Casualry
district...
[->]No matter. So long as this stranger
doesn't disturb the peace and keeps clear
of our district, I don't mind at all.
[END]
3: (Quiet man) [7a 45][13 1, 403641]The public execution had quite a sense
of occasion to it. It's something I'll
be telling my grandchildren about.
[END]
4: (Quiet man) [7a 45][13 1, 403601]The town is abuzz regarding our new
leader. I can feel our kingdom uniting
as one. I sense it in my pores...
[->]It's a feeling that's impossible to put
into words. I must repent of my sins
now...
[->]Our beloved leader has given us such a
sense of fulfillment... Whatever she
wishes, I shall carry out!
[END]
5: (Quiet man) [7a 45][13 1, 403622]There were some former Luxurors who
took issue with the new leader's orders.
[->]So I've requested the Blessed Samurai
to execute them.
[->]'Tis such joy to know that I have done
my part for the new millennium of this
kingdom...!
[END]
6: (Quiet man) [7a 45][13 1, 403621]There were some former Luxurors who
took issue with the new leader's orders.
[->]So I've requested the Blessed Samurai
to execute them.
[->]My deeds have robbed them of their
future... They, too, were privileged
to join us in the new land...
[END]
7: (Loud woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403701]There haven't been any new Samurai for
years now.
[->]I wonder if the Gauntlets will accept
anyone this year...
[END]
8: (Loud woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403702]My elderly maid heard an interesting
thing from the baker when she was out
buying bread...
[->]It seems there's a person calling himself
the Black Samurai? Is he related to
your sort?
[END]
9: (Loud woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403721]My elderly maid said that when she
passes by the Casualry district...
[->]She overhears people saying the nastiest
things about we Luxurors. I believe she
must have misheard... but...
[END]
10: (Loud woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403722]The Casualries who attended the public
execution will finally see the truth...
[->]Yes, all the negativity of late stemmed
from that Black Samurai. All of it!
[->]No one can blame the Luxurors−−after
all, we are God's chosen!
[END]
11: (Loud woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403723]There'll be no Casualries nor Luxurors
any longer.
[->]I am only an ordinary subject of the
Eastern Kingdom of Mikado now. So said
our new leader to me.
[END]
12: (Slant−eyed man) [7a 40][13 1, 403601]Is this your first time in the castle
town? You're here for the Rite, aren't
you...?
[->]It's Aquila Statue Plaza where you
want to be. You can feel the kingdom's
rich history all around you there.
[END]
13: (Slant−eyed man) [7a 40][13 1, 403621]I hear that more and more of the
Casualries are becoming interested
in that Literature.
[->]I've never heard of the Monastery
encouraging the Casualries to read...
But what matter is it to me?
[END]
14: (Slant−eyed man) [7a 40][13 1, 403612]I hear that there's a growing interest
in these ”Sabbath” gatherings among
the Casualries.
[->]I've never heard of the Monastery
encouraging the Casualries to hold
convocations... Not that I care much.
[END]
15: (Slant−eyed man) [7a 40][13 1, 403621]Since those Casualries wouldn't cease
their babbling about the Sabbaths...
[->]I snuck into a Sabbath held in Corto,
disguised as a Casualry.
[->]What I heard there was a torrent of foul
talk about our kingdom! What cheek!
I must report this to the Monastery...
[END]
16: (Slant−eyed man) [7a 40][13 1, 403603]I hear that the kingdom will not require
Luxurors for the coming millennium...
[->]Then in what way can I contribute...?
I−I don't know... what can I do?
[->]I don't know how to cultivate a field
or raise a sow... I'm coming to realize
that I'm quite useless indeed...
[END]
102: (Quiet man) [7a 45][13 1, 403642]So, that Black Samurai frequented the
Casualry district, eh?
[->]No matter. So long as this stranger
doesn't disturb the peace and keeps clear
of our district, I don't mind at all.
[END]
105: (Quiet man) [7a 45][13 1, 403622]Wh−What's happening!? I−I've just seen
some sort of animal completely unknown
to me...
[->]It ate a woman...! And worse, it's
happening everywhere in town!
[->]But our God has not abandoned us! The
Blessed Samurai are here for us...!
[->]The Eastern Kingdom of Mikado is in
great peril! Y−You must save us at
once! Hurry!
[END]
109: (Loud woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403721]I hear that the Casualries will be
permitted to view the execution.
[->]In view of the Casualries' recent
misunderstandings regarding the
Luxurors...
[->]I think that this was a wise decision
on the Monastery's part. It will clear
the air between us.
[END]
110: (Loud woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403722]That Black Samurai was executed, yes?
I saw it with my own eyes.
[->]But Mikado Castle seems to be in a state
of panic... Whatever is going on...?
[END]
111: (Loud woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403743]There'll be no Casualries nor Luxurors
in this kingdom any longer.
[->]All of those still living in this land
are chosen by God. So said our new
leader to us.
[END]
114: (Slant−eyed man) [7a 40][13 1, 403612]Those Sabbath gatherings the Casualries
favored so are now banned.
[->]What did they expect? The Casualries
were not put on this earth to discuss
and debate. Their role is to work!
[END]
202: (Quiet man) [7a 45][13 1, 403642]I hear tell that the Black Samurai will
be publicly executed in the Obelisk Plaza
this day.
[->]Most of the Casualries will be in
attendance... 'Tis an unpredecented
event in our kingdom, I must say.
[END]
211: (Loud woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403743]There'll be no Casualries nor Luxurors
in this kingdom any longer.
[->]Those still living in this land are the
ones who'll make their own decisions.
So said that young Samurai girl to us.
[END]
214: (Slant−eyed man) [7a 40][13 1, 403612]I have heard that the Black Samurai gave
the Casualries the idea for the Sabbaths,
just as she did with that Literature.
[->]Do you know what the worst thing in
this world is? Evil deeds born of good
intentions.
[END]
