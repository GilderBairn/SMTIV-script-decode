0: (Hunter man) [7a 119][13 1, 403002]You can summon demons? How'd you get
your hands on that smartphone?
[->]I thought all the phones were thrown
out except for the ones the Ashura−kai
use...
[->]I didn't get mine until I'd been
delivering Reds for a year.
[END]
1: (Hunter man) [7a 119][13 1, 403002]I'm out of Reds to keep demons away.
They're getting really hard to come by
these days...
[->]Used to be easy if you went to Shibuya
or someplace like that. They sold 'em
right on the street.
[END]
2: (Hunter man) [7a 119][13 1, 403021]The sky over Ichigaya glowed and then
a horde of demons came out...
[->]This place is still okay. But Shinjuku's
probably not so safe, since it's right
next to Ichigaya...
[END]
3: (Hunter man) [7a 119][13 1, 403002]Did you see the scoreboard at the
Association? That overall ranking thing?
[->]What's the prize for becoming champion?
Nothing, really. It won't feed you,
I can tell you that much.
[END]
4: (Hunter man) [7a 119][13 1, 403021]Hey, champ! You know, I was actually in
the tournament too...
[->]But I couldn't even crack the top ten.
It's pretty hard to hack it with the
best the Association has...
[->]That's how I know you're great, champ.
[END]
5: (Hunter man) [7a 119][13 1, 403021]Hey, champ! So you beat this Demon Lord
guy, huh?
[->]That means if I want to challenge you,
I should go through the Demon Lord
first?
[->]But I'd have to summon this Demon Lord
to fight him...
[->]Hmm. Maybe I don't want to be the
champion after all...
[END]
6: (Garrulous man) [7a 120][13 1, 403403]Strange... I ought to be getting
some reminders for my protection
money around this time of day...
[->]Ain't the Ashura−kai folks in the
Sky Tower coming today?
[END]
7: (Garrulous man) [7a 120][13 1, 403403]I saw a guy in some armor coming out
of the Sky Tower.
[->]He looked like he was right out of this
old fantasy flick about a ring...
[END]
8: (Garrulous man) [7a 120][13 1, 403403]You know, I don't see those folks in
armor coming out of the Sky Tower
anymore...
[->]These days, what I see more often is
demons coming from the Ichigaya area.
[END]
9: (Garrulous man) [7a 120][13 1, 403403]You know, I don't see those folks in
armor coming out of the Sky Tower
anymore...
[->]These days, what I see more often is
demons coming from the Ichigaya area.
[END]
10: (Garrulous man) [7a 120][13 1, 403402]...Oh, [Flynn]!
[->]Our shining hope from the Sky Tower!
You... You're like an angel...!
[->]An angel sent to us by God...!
[END]
11: (Garrulous man) [7a 120][13 1, 403403]...Oh, [Flynn]!
[->]Our shining hope from the Sky Tower!
You're like an angel sent by God...
[->]Though, uh, you earned the championship
through your own hard work. I know that
much, at least.
[END]
12: (Garrulous man) [7a 120][13 1, 403403]...Oh, [Flynn]!
[->]I saw someone in armor coming out of the
Sky Tower again! He gave the people in
town some bread as a little gift.
[->]It was real bread... I−I'd forgotten
how soft real bread was...
[END]
13: (Tough woman) [7a 66][13 1, 403323]...What!? ”Unclean one”!? Are you
talking to me, boy!?
[->]Of course, if you haven't bathed for
days, like everyone else... I said like
everyone else! Not just ME!
[END]
14: (Tough woman) [7a 66][13 1, 403323]...What!? ”Unclean one”!? What's
with you people!?
[->]That armored guy I just met called me
the same thing. How dare he!? I just
had a bath in Shinobazu Pond last night!
[END]
15: (Tough woman) [7a 66][13 1, 403312]I'm sure Hunters will protect us from
the demons...
[->]I know for sure... At least I think so...
I hope...
[END]
16: (Tough woman) [7a 66][13 1, 403302]The Hunters are fighting the good fight.
[->]We can't fight alongside them, but we
should keep our hopes up.
[END]
17: (Tough woman) [7a 66][13 1, 403302]We thought we'd lost everything
already...
[->]But all isn't lost just yet. Thanks to
you, we realize that now...
[END]
18: (Tough woman) [7a 66][13 1, 403302]We thought we'd lost everything
already...
[->]But starting now... We're going to take
back what we've lost...!
[END]
101: (Hunter man) [7a 119][13 1, 403002]I hear you can get Reds in Shibuya now.
No one tells me the details, though...
[->]Still, good to know we can get our hands
on them again if we need them.
[END]
103: (Hunter man) [7a 119][13 1, 403002]Did you see the scoreboard at the
Association? That overall ranking thing?
[->]It's way too late to sign up now. But
who was that guy in third place...?
[Flynn], was it?
[->]He's made the top three by coming up
all the way through the regular
members. Gotta admire his spirit...
[END]
107: (Garrulous man) [7a 120][13 1, 403403]I still see folks in armor coming out
of Sky Tower sometimes.
[->]They look like they're right out of this
old fantasy flick about this French
saint girl...
[END]
109: (Garrulous man) [7a 120][13 1, 403403]You know, I don't see those folks in
armor coming out of the Sky Tower
anymore...
[->]This is just a rumor, but you know
that [Flynn] at the top of the
scoreboard?
[->]He's from the Sky Tower too. Least
that's what I hear...
[END]
113: (Tough woman) [7a 66][13 1, 403323]Did you hear some guy killed Peallaidh?
[->]Now we can get to Shinobazu Pond for
a bath without having to worry about
demons...
[END]
201: (Hunter man) [7a 119][13 1, 403002]I just overheard something... Seems
like the Ring of Gaea is getting ready
to make their move.
[->]They say Yuriko prophesied that the
child of carnage shall descend from
the Firmament...
[->]I guess Tokyo will be in hot water
sometime soon, and they're using it to
their advantage to launch an attack.
[END]
301: (Hunter man) [7a 119][13 1, 403002]I just overheard something... Seems
like the Ring of Gaea is getting ready
to make their move.
[->]They say Yuriko prophesied that the
child of carnage shall descend from
the Firmament...
[->]I guess Tokyo will be in hot water
sometime soon. Ichigaya's gonna be one
big battlefield...
