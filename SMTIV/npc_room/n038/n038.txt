0: (Nosy Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 404303]Even the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado is
becoming infested with demons...
[->]'Tis better to devote oneself to
finding mystic relics in Tokyo, no?
[->]Particularly in light of the side
benefits...
[END]
1: (Nosy Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 404301]There are an astounding number of
demons... The Eastern Kingdom of Mikado
is on the cusp of annihilation.
[->]I wonder if they are hatching a counter−
plot to forestall it...?
[END]
2: (Nosy Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 404301]I heard that just like this city of
Tokyo, a swarm of demons invaded the
Eastern Kingdom of Mikado...
[->]But the angels appear to have the threat
well in hand, and all is well now.
[END]
3: (Nosy Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 404301]The angels offer little but a tight
yoke, but you... You have given the
people hope.
[->]Were I to choose one to follow,
'twould unquestionably be you.
[END]
4: (Nosy Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 404301]With the angels gone, everything is
settled for the Eastern Kingdom of
Mikado...
[->]The problem lies here, on this side.
What shall become of those demons,
I wonder...?
[END]
5: (Nosy Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 404301]I have heard that everyone is gathering
in Shinjuku.
[->]I shall be on my way there soon myself.
'Twill be good to see the old faces.
[END]
6: (Hunter woman) [7a 70][13 1, 403122]Everyone's pissed at the Ashura−kai, and
I kinda get why. It's like it used to be
with normal businesses, y'know?
[->]Your employer took care of you
financially. Well, the Ashura−kai
takes care of us too.
[->]...But since the Association is gone
now, I'm getting out of here soon too.
[END]
7: (Hunter woman) [7a 70][13 1, 403103]You're listed in the overall rankings
too, I see.
[->]Well, I'm not letting any Samurai beat
me. I'll show you how far a local Hunter
can go!
[END]
8: (Hunter woman) [7a 70][13 1, 403103]Congratulations, champion! That was
some amazing fighting.
[->]Someday, I hope to challenge you for
the top spot.
[END]
9: (Hunter woman) [7a 70][13 1, 403141]I don't believe it... You've stopped
the angelic host...
[->]You're not just the champion, you might
be the strongest warrior in the world!
[END]
10: (Hunter woman) [7a 70][13 1, 403103]Fujiwara told me that even with the
demons gone, the Association will stay
in business.
[->]He said they'll need Hunters like us
for the reconstruction of Tokyo.
[->]Maybe he was anticipating this situation
would come about someday... and that's
why he formed the Association.
[END]
100: (Nosy Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 404342]Abbot Hugo has sent a message to all
Samurai in Tokyo.
[->]It seems to be a matter of the utmost
importance... Eh? Shene Duque?
[->]I've received no messages regarding
that village...
[END]
106: (Hunter woman) [7a 70][13 1, 403103]...Hey, it's you. You're the one who
killed Xi Wangmu, right?
[->]Everyone's talking about you. Even in
Ueno and Shinjuku. A young, highly
talented Hunter...
[->]But what brought you to Ikebukuro?
The Association is gone now. I was
just on my way out too.
[END]
206: (Hunter woman) [7a 70][13 1, 403111]At my skill level, there's no way I can
beat the demon in the forest.
[->]I'm not much more than a regular citizen
with a weapon. Shame... But I've gotta
be honest with myself about this stuff.
