4: (Hunter man) [7a 99][13 1, 403043]Hey, that thing on your arm... Is that
a Demonica? I've never seen anyone but
the Shinjuku folks with one of those.
[->]Kiyoharu wanted to make an altar out of
a Demonica so he could talk to God...
[->]So we combed all of Tokyo, fighting
demons the whole time, to find another
Demonica for him.
[END]
5: (Hunter man) [7a 99][13 1, 403002]Say, where did you get your demon
summoning program?
[->][13 1, 403041]A Rite? Well, that sounds fancy. Me, I
had to grab mine off the 'net.
[->]About the same time as demons started
roaming around Tokyo, someone put it
up online as a free download.
[END]
6: (Hunter man) [7a 99][13 1, 403001]Kiyoharu looks strange, but he really
is a good guy...
[->]He actually summoned us a Messiah to
bring down Pluto, right?
[END]
7: (Hunter woman) [7a 100][13 1, 403103]I don't know where you guys are coming
from, but you lucked out, drifting to
Shinjuku.
[->]There are other shelters out there, but
Shinjuku is the only one with humans...
[->]Thanks to God's wrath, the terrain's
changed a lot. We can't even set foot
outside Tokyo anymore...
[END]
8: (Hunter woman) [7a 100][13 1, 403142]The Counter−Demon Force was a secret
commando unit formed to protect Tokyo
from demons.
[->]They managed to eliminate the demons
by cooperating with the angelic host...
[->]But you can see what good that did us.
God is gone, and humanity is dying.
[END]
9: (Hunter woman) [7a 100][13 1, 403142]Welcome back. Pluto's dead, right?
[->]Heh. God has left us, but we didn't
need him anyway.
[->]Since now we have the Messiah...
[END]
10: (Hunter woman) [7a 100][13 1, 403142]You're leaving, aren't you, Messiah?
Akira told us so...
[->]He said we had to stand tall without
relying on any Messiah. We have to
help ourselves...
[->]Because the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado
is our kingdom now...
[END]
11: (Hunter woman) [7a 100][13 1, 403142]You're back, Messiah. I know you have
a job to do...
[->]We won't rely on either you or God.
From now on, if there are obstacles to
overcome, it's us who'll do it.
[->]Because the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado
is our kingdom now...

106: (Hunter man) [7a 99][13 1, 403001]Kiyoharu looks strange, but he really
is a good guy...
[->]Sometimes, the things he says are
pretty sharp.
[->]No wonder he was chosen to communicate
with the archangels...
[END]
201: (Kiyoharu) [7a 83][13 1, 401501]Oh... Messiah...!
[->]Did you say you obtained the demon
summoning program from some sort of
rite? Really...?
[->]Is that some kind of slang or somethin'?
Because that demon summoning program...
[->]It's freeware you can download off the
Internet. We don't know who was hosting
it, though...
[END]
203: (Kiyoharu) [7a 83][13 1, 401501]Oh... Messiah...!
[->]Thank you so much! Ah, no, I didn't
mean for Pluto...
[->]You've inspired a man who can do a lot
single−handedly... I think you know
who I mean... hehehe.
[->][13 1, 401505]So ”our side” will be fine, I'm sure!
Maybe you can take a break from being
Messiah, hehe...

603: (Kiyoharu) [7a 83][13 1, 401501]Oh, hi, Messiah! Thanks for stopping by!
[->]The Eastern Kingdom of Mikado, right?
Hey, of course I'm helping establish it!
[->]See how I'm praying for everyone's
safety here? And I'm letting the young
ones do the small, fiddly jobs.
[->]Because if I take on any major work...
*cough*... Sorry.
[->]If I butt into the big stuff, I'm sure
HE'LL be back down to let me take
control of things. Hehe.
