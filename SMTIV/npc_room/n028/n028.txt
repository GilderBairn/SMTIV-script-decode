0: (Chubby man) [7a 121][13 1, 403601]Geez... I'm so hungry... Maybe I could
eat that red pill I found on the street
the other day...
[->]Wait, those things are for demons,
huh? Maybe that's not a good idea...
[END]
1: (Chubby man) [7a 121][13 1, 403601]Everyone's overreacting. So there's
a few more demons around, so what.
[->]C'mon, think about it! We got the
Ashura−kai on our side! Tayama won't
let this shit slide, right?
[END]
2: (Chubby man) [7a 121][13 1, 403642]I... I don't care about any champion.
It's a dirty trick from the Association!
[->]It's all gonna be over for Tokyo soon...
This is just a sideshow to keep people
distracted from the real problem...
[->]I mean, c'mon! Everyone's talking about
it! The angels are coming down here to
wipe us all out!
[END]
3: (Chubby man) [7a 121][13 1, 403642]I... I don't care about any champion.
It's a dirty trick from the Association!
[->]It's all gonna be over for Tokyo soon...
This is just a sideshow to keep people
distracted from the real problem...
[->]I mean, c'mon! Everyone's talking about
it! There's a Demon Lord in Ichigaya!
[END]
4: (Chubby man) [7a 121][13 1, 403642]Mr. Fujiwara sent us Shinjuku folks
a message.
[->]He said the underground district would
be crowded today, so we should stay
home as much as possible...
[->]Tokyo must be in some serious shit.
They're putting on a flashy sideshow
to keep attention off the real problem.
[->]Something's about to happen here...
Something real damn big...
[END]
6: (Rough man) [7a 59][13 1, 404301]Mr. Tayama is a truly great man.
I mean, I'd name my kids after him,
if I had kids.
[->]Even if I bump into a demon, I can just
toss him a red pill and he'll go on his
way. It's that easy...
[END]
7: (Rough man) [7a 59][13 1, 404301]H−Hey, I heard there are demons in the
underground district! Someone call the
Ashura−kai quick!
[->]The demons promised they wouldn't go
into the underground districts!
Mr. Tayama said so...!
[END]
8: (Rough man) [7a 59][13 1, 404311]H−Hey, I heard there are demons in the
underground district! Someone call
[Flynn] quick!
[->]I don't really know the dude, but
something tells me he can do something
about it!
[END]
9: (Rough man) [7a 59][13 1, 404311]Oh hey, it's [Flynn]. I hear
you're the champion, huh?
[->]Listen, there's demons inside the
underground district! I'm telling you
'cause Tayama's gone now.
[END]
10: (Rough man) [7a 59][13 1, 404301]Oh hey, it's [Flynn]. I hear
you're the champion, huh?
[->]There used to be a demon in the west
entrance of the underground district.
He took off when the Demon Lord died.
[->]Maybe he got uneasy... I'm mentioning
this to you 'cause Tayama's gone now.
[END]
12: (Ordinary woman) [7a 122][13 1, 403301]The demon in the east entrance area is
such a headache... But that demon in the
government office makes me nervous too.
[->]We'll be okay, right? Since Mr. Tayama
and the Ashura−kai are backing us up?
[END]
13: (Ordinary woman) [7a 122][13 1, 403301]I heard from the Ashura−kai folks that
the thing in the Metropolitan Government
Office is over with.
[->]I guess the Ashura−kai's elite troops
took care of the demon for us.
[->]Man... how would we get along without
the Ashura−kai? They're the best!
[END]
14: (Ordinary woman) [7a 122][13 1, 403303]I heard from the Ashura−kai folks that
the thing in the Metropolitan Government
Office is over with.
[->]I guess the Ashura−kai's elite troops
convinced the demon to leave...
[->]Man... how would we get along without
the Ashura−kai? Not only are they
tough, they're smart too.
[END]
15: (Ordinary woman) [7a 122][13 1, 403302]It's the Ring of Gaea's fault that
we've got more demons in Tokyo!
[->]The Ring of Gaea is nothing but a
freaky cult! They're no match for
the good people of the Ashura−kai!
[->]C'mon, Mr. Tayama... Wipe those freaks
out, quick!
[END]
16: (Ordinary woman) [7a 122][13 1, 403303]It's the Ring of Gaea's fault that
we've got more demons in Tokyo!
[->]The Ring of Gaea is nothing but a
freaky cult!
[->]C'mon, Mr. Tayama... Wipe those freaks
out, quick!
[END]
17: (Ordinary woman) [7a 122][13 1, 403303]It's the Ring of Gaea's fault that
we've got more demons in Tokyo!
[->]The Ring of Gaea is nothing but a
freaky cult!
[->]Oh... It's the champion! Please go
and wipe those freaks out, quick!
[END]
18: (Ordinary woman) [7a 122][13 1, 403303]I hope the people from the Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado get used to life
in Tokyo...
[->]I'll do what I can to help them
settle in.
[END]
19: (Gentle old lady) [7a 39][13 1, 403902]I've left my dear ancestral home for
a place surrounded by these strange
mystic relics...
[->]Life is not easy, and it can be full
of surprises. But I think I can get
used to this, too, in time.
[END]
20: (Hunter woman) [7a 70][13 1, 403103]Do you know those Terminals? They're
the strange devices you can find here
and there around Tokyo...
[->]Just don't get too close, or the
guardian will come out. They're these
ex−mercenaries hired by the Ashura−kai.
[->]Though they have some weird nicknames,
like ”Cosplay Pro” or ”Man of Many
Voices.” Still, they're trained killers!
[END]
100: (Chubby man) [7a 121][13 1, 403601]I hear there's a little ranch in
Shinjuku National Park. I haven't seen
it myself, though...
[->]The Ashura−kai sends folks there to
take care of livestock and crops.
[->]I wanna join them to claim just a tiny
share, but I'm too scared to leave the
underground district...
[END]
101: (Chubby man) [7a 121][13 1, 403601]Huh... the Association's up to something
strange. Some kind of tournament...
[->]M−Maybe Tokyo is finished... 'Cause
you know, this is the kind of trick
the top dogs always pull, right?
[->]A flashy sideshow to keep people's eyes
off the real problem...
[END]
106: (Rough man) [7a 59][13 1, 404301]I didn't care much about that thing
with the Corpses, but this is what I
heard from a friend of a friend...
[->]The guy who did it was a terrorist who
used to be a Hunter. He was after
the Reds.
[->]But in the end, the Ashura−kai captured
him and put a stop to it. Or so I heard.
[END]
114: (Ordinary woman) [7a 122][13 1, 403341]I heard a rumor that the guys in
Ikebukuro kicked the Ashura−kai out.
[->]See, that makes no sense to me.
They're just asking to bring the
demons back for good that way.
[->]Us regular folks can only live in Tokyo
because of what Mr. Tayama did for us.
[END]
116: (Ordinary woman) [7a 122][13 1, 403303]It's the Ring of Gaea's fault that
we've got more demons in Tokyo!
[->]The Ring of Gaea is nothing but a
freaky cult!
[->]Hey, you're a high−ranking Hunter,
right? Go and wipe those freaks out,
quick!
[END]
120: (Hunter woman) [7a 70][13 1, 403103]I hear those Ring of Gaea guys were
in Ikebukuro.
[->]This one time, some Hunter and a Ring
of Gaea guy were staring each other
down in Shinjuku...
[->]The Ring of Gaea guy silently pulled
out his falchion and sliced off the
Hunter's arm!
[->]I thought the Ashura−kai were a bunch
of tough guys, but the Ring of Gaea is
just as dangerous...
[END]
200: (Chubby man) [7a 121][13 1, 403601]Did you hear someone snuck into Shinjuku
National Park? Must've been some
daredevil...
[->]Or maybe he was just a thief after the
meat and veggies there.
[->]But what kind of nutcase would rob the
Ashura−kai? Must have some nerve...
My hat's off to him, really.
[END]
206: (Rough man) [7a 59][13 1, 404301]I didn't care much about that thing
with the Corpses, but this is what I
heard from a friend of a friend...
[->]The guy who did it was a terrorist who
used to be a Hunter. He was after
the Reds.
[->]But in the end, the Ashura−kai captured
him and put a stop to it. Or so I heard.
[END]
214: (Ordinary woman) [7a 122][13 1, 403341]Can you believe this? Those Ring of
Gaea people are talking smack about
Mr. Tayama!
[->]The Ring of Gaea is nothing but a
freaky cult! They're no match for
the good people of the Ashura−kai!
[->]How can they say those things about
Mr. Tayama!? They should shut their
filthy mouths!
[END]
220: (Hunter woman) [7a 70][13 1, 403103]Since Shinjuku is at peace now,
I thought I might go to Ikebukuro...
[->]But I heard those dangerous nutcases
are in Ikebukuro now. They're as bad
as the Ashura−kai...
[END]
300: (Chubby man) [7a 121][13 1, 403601]You know, the top dogs aren't really
great men, right? They're way shadier
than us normal folks.
[->]But it's different with those guys in
the Ashura−kai. They set up a situation
where a guy like me can get his fill.
[->]That's why I respect them, you see?
[END]
306: (Rough man) [7a 59][13 1, 404311]Looks like the Ashura−kai have their
eye on the whackjob who snuck into
Shinjuku National Park.
[->]Soon, Mr. Tayama will have 'em bring
the poor bastard in...
[->]Plus his family and everyone the
bastard knows.
[END]
314: (Ordinary woman) [7a 122][13 1, 403341]I wonder what kind of man Mr. Tayama
is... He doesn't leave Roppongi often,
so I've never seen his face...
[->]The word is he graduated from some
state university and even studied
abroad...
[->]He's a real elite. He lives in a totally
different world than us...
[END]
320: (Hunter woman) [7a 70][13 1, 403122]Slowly but surely, the Ring of Gaea is
expanding their turf.
[->]Not only that, there's some new players
in town from on up above the ceiling...
[->]Things are getting messy, I guess.
Something big is about to happen,
I can feel it.
[END]
400: (Chubby man) [7a 121][13 1, 403601]The Ring of Gaea is way too preachy.
Who gives a shit about all that stuff
about who's the strongest?
[->]Tayama's no saint, but he set things
up so a guy like me can get his fill.
[->]That's why I respect the Ashura−kai,
you see?
[END]
406: (Rough man) [7a 59][13 1, 404311]Looks like the Ashura−kai have their
eye on the whackjob who snuck into
Shinjuku National Park.
[->]It wasn't just the park, either. That
crazy bastard snuck into Kasumigaseki
too...
[->]Mr. Tayama must be pretty pissed. I feel
sorry for that bastard... and anyone
related to him.
[END]
414: (Ordinary woman) [7a 122][13 1, 403341]Can you believe this!? That Yuriko
from the Ring of Gaea has launched
an attack on Ichigaya!
[->]The Ring of Gaea is nothing but a
freaky cult! They're no match for
the good people of the Ashura−kai!
[->]How dare those losers take on
Mr. Tayama!?
[END]
506: (Rough man) [7a 59][13 1, 404311]Even I heard the rumor about the
underground district in Roppongi.
[->]But only thieves and rapists get
taken there.
[->]Mr. Tayama's generous enough to keep
our streets clean. He takes out the
bad element for us regular folks...
[END]
