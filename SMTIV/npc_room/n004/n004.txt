0: (Stern Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403001]The Gauntlet you gained in that Rite is
a critical tool for we Samurai.
[->]”How so,” you ask? You will see its
value in your training exercises...
[END]
1: (Stern Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]The Gauntlet you gained in that Rite is
a critical tool for we Samurai.
[->]Your experiences in training ought to
have proven that much. You must master
the device as soon as possible.
[END]
2: (Stern Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403002]Though you may be on leave, do not let
your mind go on holiday as well. Always
be ready for anything.
[->]Wherever you find yourself, you will
always be a Samurai. Even on holiday,
you have your duties to attend to.
[->]That said... You should visit the
castle town, since you have your
ticket of leave.
[END]
3: (Stern Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]I've decided to stay in the Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado. You see, I heard that
the Commander will do the same...
[->]I'm a Samurai. If there is anyone I can
trust with my life, it is he.
[END]
4: (Stern Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403043]I still bear a grudge against the
disrespect Abbot Hugo showed to our
Commander...
[->]But oh, how proud I am that my fellow
Samurai have captured the Black Samurai!
[END]
5: (Stern Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403002]After the execution, the Black Samurai's
corpse was taken to the Monastery.
[->]Her remains and effects are being held
as relics. The Monastery shall conduct
an examination of them.
[END]
6: (Stern Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403012]I heard this from a fellow who was
guarding the Black Samurai's remains...
[->]The Black Samurai opened the coffin by
herself and gave him a beautiful, cold
smirk...
[->]And at that moment, the fellow swore he
saw a monstrous silhouette that couldn't
have been human...
[END]
7: (Stern Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403043]When someone styles himself a leader,
I immediately feel a slight antipathy
towards him.
[->]But from their words, I feel an
unmistakable tenderness...
[->]If these new leaders wish to forge a
future for us, I would follow them to
see it realized.
[END]
8: (Stern Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403002]Thanks to our new leaders, demons are on
the verge of being driven from this land.
[->]We Samurai had to deceive the people
about the existence of demons while we
secretly worked to exterminate them...
[->]But now I am free from the guilt that
has tormented me so long. I owe our new
leaders a sincere debt of gratitude...
[END]
9: (Stern Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]The Commander has just called an
emergency meeting.
[->]I saw Isabeau reporting to him...
What is this about...?
[END]
10: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403003]I cannot believe Navarre was selected
as one of the new Samurai...
[->]He hails from a house of royal attendants
and is quite well known for living a life
of decadence.
[->]I wonder if he is up to the task of
upholding the Samurai code. It'll be
hard going for us all, I suppose...
[END]
11: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403002]I've just seen Navarre. The boy was
quite upset.
[->]Muttering things like ”Casualries have
no place dreaming of becoming Samurai”...
[->]It'll be hard going for us all,
I suppose...
[END]
12: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]Hoy... is everything all right? I mean
regarding Navarre.
[->]They say he's shut himself up in his
room and refuses to eat.
[->]And those who venture near tell me that
through the closed door, they can hear
him cackling like a madman...
[END]
13: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403002]I heard that Navarre was discharged
from his duties as a Samurai.
[->]Officially, his health was at fault,
and the Abbot Hugo granted him an
honorable discharge.
[->]But in truth, Navarre begged his family
to donate a sizable sum to make it
happen.
[->]Who else but the Luxurors could pull
such strings? Ugh, merely the thought
of it makes me like to vomit...
[END]
14: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403001]I have heard the news! You've done
fantastic work! Your achievement will
be recorded in the annals of history!
[->]My, my... The Gauntlet chose some truly
surprising recruits this year...
[->]Hrm. By that logic, Navarre may have
actually possessed some remarkable
hidden talent as well...
[END]
15: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403011]What was it that Black Samurai said
before she was executed? She claimed
that she'd resurrect, yes?
[->]Merely brave words from one facing the
end. The battle is won!
[END]
16: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403021]Speaking as he who served as executioner,
I can say with certainty that she was
pierced in the vitals.
[->]I felt the usual sensation of a lethal
blow and the enemy's life ebbing. I'm not
so dull as to miss an immobile target.
[->]So once again, I assure you, I took her
life. 'Twould be unthinkable for her to
rise again after that.
[END]
17: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]Our new leaders have proclaimed that we
must cast out all the unbelievers for
the sake of our kingdom.
[->]When I first heard the order, I doubted
the report of my own ears.
[->]But the new leaders are the sacred
mouthpieces of the Lord...
[->]And so I shall serve as executioner
with pride and honor. This is the role
I have been given...
[END]
18: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]Lately, my blade has been employed not
against demons, but to smite the
unbelievers...
[->]But come the dawn of the new millennium,
I shall be free of this burden.
[->]That is what drives me to serve as
executioner with pride and honor...
The Lord is with me always.
[END]
19: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403001]If Isabeau has told me true, the Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado is... no more...!
[->]Have our new leaders lied to us!?
But weren't we promised a new
millennium...!?
[END]
20: (Intellectual Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403041]What was that fellow's name? Jonathan?
He is a prentice of great promise.
[->]He comes from a Luxuror family, he is
a capable warrior, and he has a good
head about his shoulders. A true elite.
[END]
21: (Intellectual Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403041]I have heard about you. You took the top
spot in the training exercises, besting
even Jonathan.
[->]Everyone's eyes will be on you now,
for both good and ill...
[END]
22: (Intellectual Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403042]You're the one who returned from the
demon's Domain, yes? It is good that
you returned alive.
[->]There are countless records of Samurai
killed in Domains...
[->]It truly gladdens me to see you hale
and whole.
[END]
23: (Intellectual Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403042]King Aquila must have had his reasons
to establish the code and pass it down
to us.
[->]But Abbot Hugo dismissed it as an empty
tradition.
[->]The head of the Monastery and thus the
kingdom has insulted our first king...!
How dare he!?
[END]
24: (Intellectual Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403042]It was your tireless efforts that brought
the Black Samurai to justice at last.
[->]Hugo boasts that it was breaking the code
which led to this heroic act, justifying
his decision... But I do not accept this!
[END]
25: (Intellectual Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403042]The Black Samurai seemed to have a face
similar to Sister Gabby's. Or was it
an exact match for hers...?
[->]I examined the Black Samurai's corpse,
you know. She had the same mole below
the eye as Sister Gabby.
[->]One serves the Lord... the other defies
Him. And they share a face...?
[END]
26: (Intellectual Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403042]The Black Samurai seemed to have a face
similar to Sister Gabby's. Or was it
an exact match for hers...?
[->]I examined the Black Samurai's corpse,
you know. She had the same mole below
the eye as Sister Gabby.
[->]I know it amounts to nothing... but I
cannot abandon my suspicions toward
Sister Gabby...
[END]
27: (Intellectual Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403002]There's no ruler in this kingdom.
No king... No underhanded Luxurors...
[->]The Eastern Kingdom of Mikado has been
reborn... In God's name, we have all
come together as one.
[END]
28: (Intellectual Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403042]We've destroyed the Aquila Statue and
scraped off the writings from the
Obelisk...
[->]The true reason our people were becoming
demons was the surfeit of choice caused
by the knowledge and wisdom they found.
[->]Our duty is to protect the peace of
this kingdom. I'm sure that King Aquila
will forgive us...
[END]
29: (Intellectual Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403002]Ah... [Flynn]...! It has been so
long, my dear fellow...!
[->]Look at this... We've destroyed the
Aquila Statue on orders from our new
leaders.
[->]They said that to revere any but God
in this kingdom would be idolatry.
[->]But if we knew that the kingdom would
perish, we would not have had to
perform such a hateful deed...
[END]
30: (Smiling Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403002]So we have two Samurai from the
Casualries this year, eh?
[->]You and... Who was the other? Ah, right,
Walter from that fishing village, yes?
[END]
31: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403041]Abbot Hugo announced that the Terminal
is back in service.
[->]Now we can approach Tokyo, the country
of the Unclean Ones, without going
through Naraku.
[END]
32: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403021]I hear executions bandied about quite
often of late. I suppose Abbot Hugo is
fond of the phrase...
[->]We have ”executed” many of those who
became demons by reading Literature...
[->]Abbot Hugo told us to think of them as
”executions” rather than ”cold−blooded
murder.” If those are his wishes...
[END]
33: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403002]If the Black Samurai has resurrected...
We must start the executions anew...
[->]More of those who turn to demons must
be put to the sword...
[END]
34: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403021]I have never met the new leaders
in person...
[->]But the fact that all the demons have
disappeared from the kingdom is proof
enough of their presence...
[END]
111: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403002]I've just seen Navarre. He was smirking
for some reason...
[->]Muttering something about ”a lesson
those Casualries won't soon forget”...
[->]It'll be hard going for us all,
I suppose...
[END]
128: (Intellectual Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403011]Oh! I'm ever so glad you came!
[->]A stream of demons came from Naraku!
So many of our fellows are dead...
[->]We've destroyed the Aquila Statue and
scraped off the writings from the
Obelisk...
[->]Though we did this on orders from our
new leaders... P−Perhaps 'tis King
Aquila's curse...
[END]
129: (Intellectual Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403002]The people of the kingdom have already
departed.
[->]The Samurai have taken up the job of
escorting the people as guards, taking
them safely to a place called Shinjuku.
[->]We who remain are patrolling each
region to ensure none are left behind.
[END]
211: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403002]I've just seen Navarre headed for
Naraku... The odd thing was, he was
skipping.
[->]Muttering something about ”The Casualries
are finished!” He seemed very happy
for some reason.
[->]Perhaps he's finally found his feet as
a Samurai. In which case, I should be
cheering him on, shouldn't I?
[END]
311: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403002]Hoy... is everything all right? I mean
regarding Navarre.
[->]I saw Jonathan carrying him to the
barracks.
[->]He didn't seem hurt, but he was cackling
like a madman...
[END]
