0: (Starving man) [7a 63][13 1, 403601]I bumped into a demon the other day.
I gave him a Red so he'd leave me
alone...
[->]He wolfed it down pretty quick.
I wonder how those taste...
[END]
1: (Starving man) [7a 63][13 1, 403601]I got surrounded by demons the other
day when I was out scavenging in
Shinjuku National Park.
[->]If I didn't have a handful of reds
with me, I wouldn't be here talking
to you now.
[END]
2: (Starving man) [7a 63][13 1, 403601]By the way, did I hear that there's
a cafe in Shinjuku? I don't get out
from underground much, so...
[->]If it's true, I wonder if there's any
food left there. I always loved having
a pastry with my morning coffee...
[END]
3: (Demon) [7a 65018][13 1, 412105]What is it, human? You seem puzzled.
Does my presence here make you
uncomfortable?
[->]Not that I care a fig for your feelings.
But if you have a problem with me...
By all means, let's hear it.
[END]
100: (Starving man) [7a 63][13 1, 403601]H−Hey, you think the rumor is true?
Ashura−kai forbids it, so I don't
really know, but...
[->]If... if I eat a red pill... Will I
really turn into a demon?
[END]
101: (Starving man) [7a 63][13 1, 403601]They haven't captured the guy who snuck
into Shinjuku National Park yet, right?
[->]Lucky bastard... He must've stuffed
himself on all the meat there...
[->]Maybe the Ashura−kai's security has
some holes... Think I should try?
[END]
102: (Starving man) [7a 63][13 1, 403601]What if... What if the Ring of Gaea
defeats the Ashura−kai...?
[->]The Ring of Gaea wouldn't spare the
life of anyone without any special
skills like me, would they...?
[->]Ahhhhhhghhhh! Thinking about it
makes me hungryyyyy!
[END]
202: (Starving man) [7a 63][13 1, 403601]What if... What if the Ring of Gaea
defeats the Ashura−kai...?
[->]The Ring of Gaea wouldn't spare the
life of anyone without any special
skills like me, would they...?
[->]Ahhhhhhghhhh! Thinking about it
makes me hungryyyyy! The Ashura−kai
just HAVE to win this war!
