0: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403421]Huh? Club Milton? You want to head
for Dogenzaka, then go into the back
of the alley.
[->]...But I'm sure you're only wasting
your time if you try to go there now.
[END]
1: (Demon) [7a 65405][13 1, 414203]So this is that Shibuya place
everyone's talking about, huh?
Pretty lively...
[->]The people here used to think this
place was the birthplace of new
trends, right?
[->]All right, then. From now on, we
demons will make all kinds of new
trends out of this place!
[END]
2: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403441]Wha−hey! I didn't expect the Hunters
to do such a good job.
[->]If they keep this up, they might
beat both the demons and the
angels...
[END]
3: (Demon) [7a 65405][13 1, 414203]So this is that Shibuya place
everyone's talking about, huh?
Pretty lively...
[->]If the angels come here, I can
assume things will only get livelier.
[->]Of course, when that happens, there
will be absolutely no hope for the
humans afterwards...
[END]
4: (Demon) [7a 65405][13 1, 414203]So this is that Shibuya place
everyone's talking about, huh?
Pretty lively...
[->]If that ”Champion” guy gets killed
by the Demon Lord, things will only
get livelier, I'm sure.
[->]Of course, when that happens, there
will be absolutely no hope for the
humans afterwards...
[END]
5: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403402]Yo! The decisive battle between the
angels and demons is over, right!?
[->]I still can't believe it...
I'm not dreaming, am I...?
[END]
100: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403421]It looks like Club Milton's been
reopened. ...Does that mean someone's
defeated that demon?
[->]Some Ashura−kai guy once told me that
the place was taken over by a demon
who wanted to take all the Reds...
[END]
200: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403421]I was talking with some Ashura−kai
dudes about that Koga Saburo.
He's some evil dude, isn't he?
[->]He tried to keep all the Reds for
himself, right? We don't need
selfish people like that in Tokyo!
[END]
