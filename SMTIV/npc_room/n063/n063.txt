0: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 47][13 1, 404303]I'm surprised you managed to come
here. What was Tenkai doing...?
[->]Well, that's fine. Shibuya's back in
business, so we got a huge additional
order from them.
[->]You must be the new help we were
told about. Hurry up and get to the
farm.
[END]
1: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 47][13 1, 404303]We've been getting so many orders from
Shibuya that we can't even take time
to sleep.
[->]I don't know what's going on out
there, but it looks like the Red
Bubble's blowing up again!
[END]
2: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 47][13 1, 404303]I get the feeling that we're going
to be getting fewer Red orders from
Shibuya.
[->]I don't know what's going on out
there, but has the new Red Bubble
burst already? ...Nah, can't be.
[END]
100: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 47][13 1, 404303]Hey there, new guy. Looks like you
got Mastema to take the barrier down.
[->]We're so busy right now that we need
all the help we can get.
[->]Now stop standing around and hurry
up to the farm.
[END]
200: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 47][13 1, 404303]Mr. Tayama's one cautious man.
He's going to increase Red production
just in case anything happens.
[->]But if that bitch Yuriko were to
take control of Yamato and push
that button...
[->]Things will get so bad that I don't
think extra Reds will be enough...
[END]
