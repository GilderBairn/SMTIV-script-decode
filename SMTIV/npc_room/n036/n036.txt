0: (Wishy−washy man) [7a 121][13 1, 403012]This CAN'T be happening! I just took a
detour to get here from Shibuya...
[->]And all the shops in Ikebukuro are
closed!
[END]
1: (Wishy−washy man) [7a 121][13 1, 403022]At this rate, the demons will eat
us all!
[->]Please, Ashura−kai! Come back here
and save us!
[END]
2: (Wishy−washy man) [7a 121][13 1, 403041]Some samurai named [Flynn] is
climbing the ranks...
[->]He's an outsider with amazing skills.
This guy might be a serious contender
for champion...
[END]
3: (Wishy−washy man) [7a 121][13 1, 403003]Guess what! I'm becoming a Hunter!
[->]After seeing you in action, I just
can't sit around and do nothing...!
[END]
4: (Wishy−washy man) [7a 121][13 1, 403403]Guess what! I'm becoming a Hunter!
[->]There are way more strong demons around
these days. It's a great time to start
hunting 'em!
[END]
5: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 47][13 1, 403603]The guys in Ikebukuro are all idiots.
They were hooting with joy when they
kicked us out...
[->]Well, guess what? Now the town belongs
completely to the demons. The owner of
the Association ran away too...
[->]And with no Association, no Hunters
will bother showing their faces.
[->]It's like it's gone back to how it was
when the ceiling first appeared. Wonder
how long it'll take to get it back...
[END]
6: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 47][13 1, 403603]If I'd known this would happen, I woulda
ditched Ikebukuro and went home.
[->]That miserable bunch can't even wipe
up their own shit. I'd hate to be on
the same boat as those losers.
[->]Or did I not manage 'em right...?
[END]
7: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 47][13 1, 403642]The guys in Ikebukuro are so damn
simple, y'know? Guess what they said
when I told 'em about you, ”Champ”?
[->]They thanked me! ME! The guy who used
to be part of the Ashura−kai!
[->]Those dumbasses... Did I not teach 'em
right when I was their boss?
[END]
8: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 47][13 1, 403603]The guys in Ikebukuro are so damn
simple, y'know? Guess what they said
when I told 'em the demons were gone?
[->]They thanked me! ME! The guy who used
to be part of the Ashura−kai!
[->]Those dumbasses... Did I not teach 'em
right when I was their boss?
[END]
9: (Sighing woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403312]The guys who kicked out the Ashura−kai
are acting like they're some kind of
heroes...
[->]But without the Ashura−kai here,
Xi Wangmu took over this town in
no time.
[END]
10: (Flashy woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403503]My ex was in the Ashura−kai. But he got
beaten up and kicked out of town.
[->]They broke his nose, pulled out his
hair... He looked awful. I'm more afraid
of the people here than the Ashura−kai!
[END]
12: (Flashy woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403522]A woman from the underground district
committed suicide by biting off her
own tongue.
[->]We gave her corpse to the demons out
there to keep them at bay for now...
[->]But I can't help wondering if they'll
kill me, too, in my sleep.
[->]I keep wishing over and over that we
could be free from this suffering...
[END]
13: (Flashy woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403522]I'm away from home for a few days to
hang out with the Ashura−kai and
Ikebukuro turns into a huge mess...
[->]I almost always welcomed death before.
But now...
[->]I just wanted to tell you one thing,
champion: Thank you.
[END]
14: (Flashy woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403522]Ever since the demons came to Tokyo,
I was looking for a good time and
place to die.
[->]But it seems I've lost all that, along
with my chance to find Mr. Right.
[->]I guess it's all your fault, haha.
...Thanks, champion.
[END]
100: (Wishy−washy man) [7a 121][13 1, 403012]I just took a detour to get here from
Shibuya... and all the shops in Ikebukuro
are closed!
[->]Well, I don't have much choice now.
I'll keep going a little to Shinjuku...
[END]
105: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 47][13 1, 403603]Those guys in Ikebukuro are pathetic...
The moment Xi Wangmu got whacked, they
started to puff their chests at us.
[->]I do what Mr. Tayama tells me to, of
course. But how could a place without
even a shop have any value to us?
[->]Heh, maybe we should just convert
everyone who lives there into...
You know.
[END]
106: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 47][13 1, 403603]I heard a rumor that the Association's
up to something...
[->]But there's no way to check, since we
got no Association in Ikebukuro.
[END]
109: (Sighing woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403312]I just want to leave this demon−infested
city as soon as possible...
[->]But when the Ashura−kai left town,
all the Reds went with them.
[->]I can't fight demons... I can't even
buy weapons. Talk about a no−win
situation...
[END]
111: (Flashy woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403503]I heard a strange rumor that the
Ashura−kai were making a comeback...
[->]But my ex was Ashura−kai, so I kinda
know what is and isn't likely...
[->]The Ashura−kai wouldn't waste manpower
and time on a town like this if there
was nothing in it for them.
[END]
200: (Wishy−washy man) [7a 121][13 1, 403041]I thought I'd enjoy some R&R in Shibuya
after coming back from stocking up on
supplies in Shinjuku.
[->]But I saw they started to sell Reds in
Ikebukuro again, so I came right back. I'd
hate to miss an opportunity like that!
[END]
205: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 47][13 1, 403603]Percentage−wise, this town doesn't have
as many women. But I'm sure it'll do
just fine...
[->]The question is whether the men can
work out here. Once they're in Roppongi,
they've gotta stick to it...
[END]
209: (Sighing woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403312]Someone brought some Reds from Shibuya!
Thank you, lord!
[->]I don't mind paying a fortune for some
Reds if I have to. I'd even sell my
organs if need be...
[END]
211: (Flashy woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403503]I heard from an old flame in the
Ashura−kai that everyone in Ikebukuro
is going to be sent to Roppongi...
[->]In a couple days, I guess I'll be part
of the ”harvest” too.
[END]
300: (Wishy−washy man) [7a 121][13 1, 403012]Whatever happened to the folks in
Ikebukuro...?
[->]They're suddenly saying they don't need
the Reds anymore. I thought this would
be a great business opportunity...
[END]
305: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 47][13 1, 403603]My buddies in Roppongi tell me that
Mr. Tayama's quota is tough to meet.
[->]Hmm... Ikebukuro will be thinned out
a little, but we can fix that, you know
what I mean?
[END]
309: (Sighing woman ) [7a 62][13 1, 403312]I just realized something... It doesn't
matter if I spend everything I have
on Reds, or if I get eaten alive...
[->]It's just me who'd suffer.
[->]But if I'm going to scream in despair,
I'm going to scream while fighting.
So I won't need the Reds anymore...
[END]
311: (Flashy woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403503]I heard from an old flame in the
Ashura−kai that everyone in Ikebukuro
is going to be sent to Roppongi...
[->]But the people of Ikebukuro decided to
fight back against the Ashura−kai.
[->]I'm glad we're saved, but honestly...
How many more times do we have to
suffer like this?
[END]
405: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 47][13 1, 403603]The guys in Ikebukuro are all idiots.
They were hooting with joy when they
kicked us out...
[->]If they'd come to Roppongi, at least
they wouldn't have to starve.
[->]Their pride was their downfall...
Grade−A fools, all of 'em.
[END]
409: (Sighing woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403312]I just realized something... It doesn't
matter if I spend everything I have
on Reds, or if I get eaten alive...
[->]It's just me who'd suffer.
[->]But if I'm going to scream in despair,
I'm going to scream while fighting.
I don't need the Reds or the Ashura−kai.
[END]
