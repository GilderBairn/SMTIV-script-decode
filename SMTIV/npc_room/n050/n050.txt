0: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 54][13 1, 404402]The Ring of Gaea is no mere collection
of hoodlums, like the Ashura−kai.
[->]We don't ask for money from civilians,
nor do we start random wars against
them.
[->]But, if anyone shows us hostility,
we will use our favored demons to
crush them.
[END]
1: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 54][13 1, 404431]For those of us in the Ring of Gaea,
people are the catalysts to our
strength...
[->]We don't exploit or sacrifice the
people to get ahead.
[->]The Ring of Gaea is not like the
Ashura−kai. If you will be one of
us, you must stay noble and proud.
[END]
2: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 54][13 1, 404443]Tayama allows the weak to survive
solely so he can exploit them.
[->]Lady Yuriko tells us that we don't
need to have mercy on the weak.
[->]We are aware that Tokyo is a mess...
and supplies are scarce...
[->]If things stay as they are...
You know who is right for this city,
don't you?
[->]The choice is between Tayama and
Lady Yuriko... and I believe you
have made the correct decision.
[END]
3: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 54][13 1, 404412]Tayama allows the weak to survive
solely so he can exploit them.
[->]Lady Yuriko tells us that we don't
need to have mercy on the weak.
[->]We are aware that Tokyo is a mess...
and supplies are scarce...
[->]If things stay as they are...
Between Tayama and Lady Yuriko, you
know what is right for this city.
[->]And yet, sadly, you have made the
wrong decision.
[END]
4: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 54][13 1, 404403]Soon, we will begin an all−out
assault on Ichigaya.
[->]I'm sure the Ashura−kai know what
we're up to. They aren't stupid...
[->]But if they want to get into a true
contest of power, they have one.
We will crush them like bugs!
[END]
5: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 54][13 1, 404421]Our assault on Ichigaya had begun.
We were going to kill Tayama and
take control of the Yamato Reactor...
[->]But, suddenly, there was a blinding
flash, and the place was filled with
demons...
[->]Most of my comrades died there, but
I made it back, somehow...
[->]Even Lady Yuriko is gone...
I'm afraid.
[END]
6: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 54][13 1, 404441]I don't know about the other members
of the Ring of Gaea, but now that
I've seen you, I realize one thing...
[->]I... I just wanted a safe place to
stay. This ”power and skill” thing
was just a lie I told myself...
[->]And the hope I used to place in
Lady Yuriko... You have it now.
[END]
7: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 54][13 1, 404441]They say a Demon Lord is dwelling in
Ichigaya... I only heard his name
once, from Lady Yuriko.
[->]His real name is Lucifer, king of
all demons...
[->]I'm still a member of Ring of Gaea,
so I can't support you openly...
[->]...But I don't want you to die.
That is how I truly feel.
[END]
8: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 54][13 1, 404442]The Demon Lord has been defeated.
Tokyo will return to its former self.
[->]But there are still many who blindly
worship Lady Yuriko.
[->]I will shake them awake. That is how
I will atone for my deeds...
[->]I have a responsibility to the people
of Tokyo.
[END]
