0: (Jonathan) [7a 3][13 1, 400101]As a boy, I had my doubts about training
each day when I lived in such a tranquil
land...
[->]But today is the day I truly sense my
father's deep love for me.
[->]Had it not been for those days spent
training, I expect I should be lying
now in a pool of my own blood...
[END]
1: (Dignified Samurai) [7a 116]Yes... you must be bone tired now.
Please, don't mind me.
[END]
2: (Dignified Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]Yes, the Unclean Ones' country demands
our attention, but I worry about the
Eastern Kingdom of Mikado as well.
[->]If the Black Samurai's Literature has
spread, we may be facing demons in every
region of the kingdom.
[->]But no... I must take these troubles
one at a time. The Black Samurai has
precedence.
[END]
3: (Cheerful Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403001]Hello, prentice. I see you're working
hard at your training.
[->]Tell me, have you ever wished for more
money than your salary offers? I may
have the answer you seek...
[END]
4: (Cheerful Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403002]I've read in the Monastery's historical
documents of rare relics that can be
found in the depths of Naraku.
[->]In truth, I grow bored of fulfilling the
same role each day. I know not what the
Monastery schemes, but I play my part.
[END]
5: (Angel) [7a 65461][13 1, 412001]The sons of man do not know that we are
preventing the demons from invading.
[->]And that is as it should be. If we
angels were to grow less distanced from
the sons of man...
[->]Then God's desire to raise the sons of
man as the shepherds of the earth
would go unmet.
[END]
6: (Isabeau) [7a 5][13 1, 400301]...Ah, [Flynn].
[->]I'm performing a sweep of Naraku to
ensure our fellows are not here.
[->]The situation is too grave to permit any
misunderstandings. I felt that I should
personally attend to this...
[->]But worry not, I can manage on my own.
The Great Spirit of Spite, now become
the ”Demon Lord,” is your task.
[END]
100: (Jonathan) [7a 3][13 1, 400102]So these are training exercises for a
Samurai. I'm exhausted as I've never
been before...
[->]Naturally, I aim to finish first, but
I must take care not to overdo it and
withdraw to recover myself if needed.
[END]
101: (Dignified Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]This is a pretty spot of trouble
Navarre's gotten himself into.
Caught in a demon's Domain...
[->]I saw him on the way out. From the look
of it, he may have difficulties resuming
his duties.
[END]
103: (明朗なサムライ) [7a 29][13 1, 403043]修道院で歴史書を読んだことがある
ナラクの奥には珍しい遺物があるらしい
[->]…正直 毎日同じ役割で退屈してたんだ
修道院が何か企んでようが 俺は乗るよ
[END]
200: (Jonathan) [7a 3][13 1, 400101]Casualries and Luxurors were both given
their roles by God...
[->]I suppose, as this is a solemn contest
amongst Samurai, 'twould be uncouth for
me to object to it.
[->]But I pray that you and Walter find
luck. Though I would rather you not let
on to Navarre...
[END]
201: (Dignified Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403003]...You've come, prentice. A Samurai's
training exercises are rigorous.
[->]Pardon me for being forward, but will
you allow me to pass on some useful
advice?
[END]
203: (Cheerful Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403001]Hello, prentice. I see you're working
hard at your training.
[->]If you happened to squander your salary
from the Commander, I have a solution,
if you'd care to hear it.
[END]
300: (Jonathan) [7a 3][13 1, 400101]Hm? Navarre? Are you worried for him?
[->]Well then, why don't we attempt to
raise him?
[END]
301: ”By all means.”
”That won't be necessary.”
[END]
303: Ask him to tell you
Decline his offer
[END]
400: 〉 Jonathan operates his Gauntlet...
[END]
401: (Dignified Samurai) [7a 116]'Twas not the people of the Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado who dug Naraku.
[->]As the Monastery has it, this cavern
seems to have been in place since the
founding of our kingdom.
[->]The demons and mystic relics have been
in existence as long as Naraku has...
[->]If some predecessor to our kingdom dug
this... then to what purpose...?
[END]
403: (Cheerful Samurai) [7a 29]Take the mystic relics you unearth to
each of the shops in Aquila Statue Plaza.
[->]Q and B will gladly appraise them and
buy them from you. With the Monastery's
blessing, of course.
[->]Remember well how lucrative the sale of
mystic relics can be. I myself have oft
made use of it when my purse was light.
[END]
500: (Jonathan) [7a 3]Odd... No response. Perhaps he's in the
thick of battle with a demon...?
[END]
501: (Dignified Samurai) [7a 116]Of course... you are in the midst of
your training, after all. Pardon.
[END]
503: (Cheerful Samurai) [7a 29]You must be quite responsible when it
comes to fiduciary matters. An estimable
trait in someone so young...
[END]
