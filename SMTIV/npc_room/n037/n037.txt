0: (Sighing woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403312]The guys who kicked out the Ashura−kai
are acting like they're some kind of
heroes...
[->]But without the Ashura−kai here,
Xi Wangmu took over this town in
no time.
[END]
1: (Sighing woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403312]The guys who were opposing the
Ashura−kai didn't know anything
about them.
[->]They've been looking out for us this
whole time... But it's too late now.
[END]
2: (Sighing woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403342]You have to have hope and stand on your
own. That's what I learned from you.
[->]I know it'll be tough to do... But I
also know I can do it.
[END]
3: (Panting woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403303]Most people are trying to become self−
sufficient in their own way...
[->]It's thanks to the hope you gave us.
Thank you, champion.
[END]
4: (Flashy woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403503]My ex was in the Ashura−kai. But he got
beaten up and kicked out of town.
[->]They broke his nose, pulled out his
hair... He looked awful. I'm more afraid
of the people here than the Ashura−kai!
[END]
5: (Flashy woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403522]A woman from the underground district
committed suicide by biting off her
own tongue.
[->]We gave her corpse to the demons out
there to keep them at bay for now...
[->]But I can't help wondering if they'll
kill me, too, in my sleep.
[->]I keep wishing over and over that we
could be free from this suffering...
[END]
6: (Flashy woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403522]I'm away from home for a few days to
hang out with the Ashura−kai and
Ikebukuro turns into a huge mess...
[->]I almost always welcomed death before.
But now...
[->]I just wanted to tell you one thing,
champion: Thank you.
[END]
7: (Flashy woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403522]Ever since the demons came to Tokyo,
I was looking for a good time and
place to die.
[->]But it seems I've lost all that, along
with my chance to find Mr. Right.
[->]I guess it's all your fault, haha.
...Thanks, champion.
[END]
100: (Sighing woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403312]I just want to leave this demon−infested
city as soon as possible...
[->]But when the Ashura−kai left town,
all the Reds went with them.
[->]I can't fight demons... I can't even
buy weapons. Talk about a no−win
situation...
[END]
104: (Flashy woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403503]I heard a strange rumor that the
Ashura−kai were making a comeback...
[->]But my ex was Ashura−kai, so I kinda
know what is and isn't likely...
[->]The Ashura−kai wouldn't waste manpower
and time on a town like this if there
was nothing in it for them.
[END]
200: (Sighing woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403312]Someone brought some Reds from Shibuya!
Thank you, lord!
[->]I don't mind paying a fortune for some
Reds if I have to. I'd even sell my
organs if need be...
[END]
204: (Flashy woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403503]I heard from an old flame in the
Ashura−kai that everyone in Ikebukuro
is going to be sent to Roppongi...
[->]In a couple days, I guess I'll be part
of the ”harvest” too.
[END]
300: (Sighing woman ) [7a 62][13 1, 403312]I just realized something... It doesn't
matter if I spend everything I have
on Reds, or if I get eaten alive...
[->]It's just me who'd suffer.
[->]But if I'm going to scream in despair,
I'm going to scream while fighting.
So I won't need the Reds anymore...
[END]
304: (Flashy woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403503]I heard from an old flame in the
Ashura−kai that everyone in Ikebukuro
is going to be sent to Roppongi...
[->]But the people of Ikebukuro decided to
fight back against the Ashura−kai.
[->]I'm glad we're saved, but honestly...
How many more times do we have to
suffer like this?
[END]
400: (Sighing woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403312]I just realized something... It doesn't
matter if I spend everything I have
on Reds, or if I get eaten alive...
[->]It's just me who'd suffer.
[->]But if I'm going to scream in despair,
I'm going to scream while fighting.
I don't need the Reds or the Ashura−kai.
