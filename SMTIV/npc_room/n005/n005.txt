0: (Hope) [7a 8][13 1, 400601]You're about to undergo the first
training for your new life. If you are
worried, then it is as you should be.
[->]You'll find your fellows in the plaza,
or perhaps in Naraku. You should hark
what they have to tell you.
[->]You should always be receptive to useful
information. That's one of the basic
precepts of being a Samurai.
[END]
1: (Calm Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403002]Training exercises, eh? There's a phrase
I've not heard in some time. We haven't
had any recruits to train in years!
[->]But allow me to warn you of one thing.
Do not take the training lightly, or the
price could be your life.
[END]
2: (Calm Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403002]The lady's ring you found in Naraku...
[->]There's an engraving on the back of it,
dated around 30 years ago.
[->]The Commander was about your age at
that time...
[->]Now, this is merely my conjecture, you
understand... But I'm certain that ring
belongs to...
[END]
3: (Calm Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403042]About what happened in Naraku...
You may be sure the Commander will hear
of it.
[->]Navarre and his cronies will face a
stiff punishment, I expect.
[->]The Commander isn't the talkative sort,
but hours of his silent stare... 'Tis
the worst punishment you could imagine.
[END]
4: (Calm Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403002]The Commander seemed so even−tempered
at the emergency meeting. Though I know
he was upset beyond words...
[->]They stay safely cloistered inside the
Monastery, save for when they wish to
manipulate events in their favor.
[->]Abbot Hugo merely wanted to publicly
display he carries more weight in
Mikado than our Commander.
[END]
5: (Calm Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403042]Hello, young heroes of the kingdom!
I bring you tidings from the Commander,
who is in the Obelisk Plaza now.
[->]You are all worthy of receiving the
Third Order of Merit. I've never
seen the Commander so pleased.
[END]
6: (Calm Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403001]Though the Black Samurai was executed,
sightings of demons throughout the
kingdom persist.
[->]Is it because of the wisdom and knowledge
she mentioned? Such unwanted gifts...!
[END]
7: (Calm Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403002]Any Samurai not assigned to recover the
mystic relics are to join the sweep
of the kingdom.
[->]All Samurai must work in harmony to
improve the kingdom's security.
[->]You recipients of the Third Order of
Merit will pursue her in Tokyo...
[->]She has nowhere to hide now. She can
resurrect all she likes, but we will
bury her again and again!
[END]
8: (Calm Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403042]We had an emergency meeting while you
were away.
[->]Abbot Hugo convened it. He announced
that the kingdom will be under new
leadership...
[->]And that Hugo will act as a mouthpiece
for the new leaders to the people.
[END]
9: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403003]Ah, hello, newcomer. How was your
first foray into Naraku? Hard, no?
[->]If you are tired, go back to barracks
and take a nap.
[END]
10: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403003]The Commander tells me you're going to
K's Tavern?
[->]Since the training exercises are
concluded, you are officially Samurai.
[END]
11: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403002]I heard from Walter that you met
someone in Naraku, yes?
[->]As you've seen, the entrance to Naraku
is guarded extremely tightly.
[->]It is hard to believe you could have
spied a girl and a boy inside...
[END]
12: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403001]If it's the bottom of Naraku you seek,
you need only keep descending...
[->]But as no one has ever reached its
bottom, there is no one to advise you
in this quest.
[->]Prepare your weapons, armor, goods,
and demons as best you can.
[END]
13: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403041]Abbot Hugo announced that the Terminal
is back in service.
[->]Now we can approach Tokyo, the country
of the Unclean Ones, without going
through Naraku.
[END]
14: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403042]I hear executions bandied about quite
often of late. I suppose Abbot Hugo is
fond of the phrase...
[->]We have ”executed” many of those who
became demons by reading Literature...
[->]Abbot Hugo told us to think of them as
”executions” rather than ”cold−blooded
murder.” If those are his wishes...
[END]
15: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403002]If the Black Samurai has resurrected...
We must start the executions anew...
[->]More of those who turn to demons must
be put to the sword...
[END]
16: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403021]I have never met the new leaders
in person...
[->]But the fact that all the demons have
disappeared from the kingdom is proof
enough of their presence...
[END]
17: (Forceful Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]You have now seen firsthand the menace
of demons.
[->]But once they are fighting at your
side, your mission to protect our
kingdom will go a bit more smoothly.
[->]To recruit demons as allies...
[->]Sometimes I'm overwhelmed by the grandeur
of King Aquila's vision. I would have
never thought of it on my own...
[END]
18: (Forceful Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403012]I heard from Isabeau that there are
some sneaks among the fellows, eh?
[->]Using the darkness of Naraku to rig
a prank... I don't know who's worse,
the demons or those scoundrels.
[END]
19: (Forceful Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]I've read in our lore that if one is
to reach the bottom of Naraku...
[->]One would face a legendary demon with
incredible might, which served as one
of King Aquila's own allies...
[END]
20: (Forceful Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403011]I spoke briefly with the Black Samurai
just before her execution...
[->]”Why did you provide the people with
Literature?” I asked. And in response...
[->]”It's what the people of the kingdom
wanted,” she said.
[END]
21: (Forceful Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403021]I spoke briefly with the Black Samurai
just before her execution...
[->]”Why did you provide the people with
Literature?” I asked. And in response...
[->]”It's what the people of the kingdom
wanted,” she said.
[END]
22: (Forceful Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403021]I dreamt that I spoke to our new
leaders...
[->]”Why did you come to our kingdom?”
I asked. And in response...
[->]”It's what the people of the kingdom
wanted,” they said.
[END]
23: (Weary Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403203]...I was in Tokyo as well. I made the
trip back to the castle town the other
day and decided to visit my nephew.
[->]He'd grown so much... I was only in
Tokyo for a day or so.
[->]Could it be that time flows differently
in Tokyo than in our kingdom? I wonder...
[END]
24: (Weary Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403203]I was supposed to be back on my original
posting in our kingdom...
[->]But thanks to that Black Samurai, I'm
bound once more for Tokyo.
[END]
25: (Weary Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403203]Hoy. You seem to share my predicament
somewhat...
[->]I've just returned from Tokyo to find
the kingdom in a shambles. It's like
a different country now...
[END]
100: (Hope) [7a 8][13 1, 400601]Abbot Hugo tells me you've successfully
entered Tokyo. Is that true?
[->]......
[->]I am sorry that I can't find any praise
to give you on your achievement...
[END]
101: (Calm Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403002]You took first place, yes? So then, you
saw the ring, I expect?
[->]When the Commander is tipsy, he always
speaks of a woman he left back in his
home village...
[->]Now, this is merely my conjecture, you
understand... But I'm certain that ring
belongs to...
[END]
104: (Calm Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403042]The monks at the Monastery mock our
Commander, saying he keeps too strictly
to the code.
[->]But the people are very frightened of
demons now. If our Commander did not
make a show of easing their fears...
[->]Then the people's sense of security and
trust in we Samurai would be shaken.
Hence his tour of the kingdom.
[->]I'm sure that if he could, the Commander
would be among the first into Tokyo to
strike down the Black Samurai...
[END]
108: (Calm Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403042]This kingdom was founded by God. But so
then why have demons come here?
[->]The question tormented me... But now
that the demons are driven out, I think
I understand the answer...
[->]Perhaps God granted us a chance to
prove ourselves by trial, believing
that we would prevail in the end.
[->]What a stern love and trust... Only our
Father could have brought them to us...
[END]
109: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403003]Was that... Walter, I think his name
was? He said he was headed down to
Naraku.
[->]He just came from his training exercises
and is already rushing back in. That
takes a certain kind of madness...
[END]
110: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403003]The Commander tells me you're going to
K's Tavern?
[->]Have you had a look at the blackboard
yet? Ah... just go and enjoy yourselves.
[END]
116: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403021]Isabeau was urging us not to rely on
the new leaders.
[->]Though they have shown us miracles upon
miracles, they remain silent when a
crisis befalls us...
[->]In the end, we must choose our own
course... I think I understand what
Isabeau was getting at.
[END]
119: (Forceful Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]...What!? You've defeated King Aquila's
own demon!?
[->]I'm happy for your safe return, and for
your incredible achievement...
[->]But when I think of how King Aquila
would take it... I simply can't cheer
the news. I'm sorry...
[END]
122: (Forceful Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403021]I had a dream... And in this dream,
I saw our new leaders unite as one...
[->]”Why did you become one?” I asked.
And in response...
[->]”It's what our Lord wished,” they said.
[END]
200: (Hope) [7a 8][13 1, 400601]I hear that some of the Black Samurai's
disciples were executed.
[->]Her dark work eroded the fabric of our
society more than we could foresee...
[->]Damn you, Black Samurai... Even in death,
you are a grave threat to our kingdom's
well−being...
[END]
208: (Calm Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403042]On the Commander's orders, we've alerted
the nearby villages to the situation and
brought their people to the castle.
[->]Still... abandoning the Eastern Kingdom
of Mikado and setting out for a new
land...
[->]Do you think they will take to such
an idea...?
[END]
210: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403003]The Commander tells me you're going to
K's Tavern?
[->]If you're of a mind to take on the
challenge quests, make sure you
properly register for them.
[END]
216: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403021]Abbot Hugo convened an emergency meeting
for the people gathered in Mikado Castle.
[->]We are to abandon the Eastern Kingdom
of Mikado and emigrate to Tokyo as our
new home...
[->]The abbot's final words brought tears
to my eyes...
[->]We abandon this land not out of despair,
but out of hope. The hope for us all to
finally come into our own...
[END]
222: (Forceful Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403021]I saw it in my dream... Our new leaders
gradually disappearing...
[->]”Why are you leaving us?” I asked.
And in response...
[->]”The people of this kingdom no longer
need us,” they said.
[END]
300: (Hope) [7a 8][13 1, 400601]Sister Gabby proclaimed that we are to
thoroughly investigate every region of
the kingdom...
[->]That we might sooner find the Black
Samurai and end her life.
[->]She is a soft−spoken woman, but there
is no remorse or regret in her words.
[->]She is an iron−willed lady with some
of the strongest convictions I know.
[END]
310: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403003]I see you're completing the challenge
quests in fine form.
[->]More of them will be added to the
blackboard as needed.
[->]When there is something new to see,
Burroughs will inform you. Let her
handle that part...
[END]
400: (Hope) [7a 8][13 1, 400601]I returned from the expedition on orders
from Abbot Hugo...
[->]Only to find King Ahazuya of Mikado
and all his servants exiled from
Mikado Castle.
[->]It was the decision of our new leaders.
They said the old order is no longer
needed...
[END]
500: (Hope) [7a 8][13 1, 400601]Hmm... So that's what happened between
Jonathan and Walter...
[->]......
[->]I left my fiancee behind when I became
a Samurai. Before I knew it, I was the
order's commander...
[->]Now, the trappings of my station prevent
me from speaking freely. I envy those
who can...
[END]
600: (Hope) [7a 8][13 1, 400601]Jonathan... [Flynn]...
[->]We Samurai will search the Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado again on the orders
of our new leaders.
[->]Our task is to hunt the Luxurors who
fled the castle, as well as all the
Black Samurai's remaining disciples.
[->]This will be the last necessary tragedy
of this kingdom. That... is what our
new leaders have told us...
[->]I will give my life, if necessary, to
carry out my mission. I shall be this
kingdom's shield. 
[->]And you shall be its sword...
I'm counting on you.
[END]
700: (Hope) [7a 8][13 1, 400601]Walter... [Flynn]...
[->]We Samurai will search the Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado again on the orders
of our new leaders.
[->]Our task is to hunt the Luxurors who
fled the castle, as well as all the
Black Samurai's remaining disciples.
[->]This will be the last necessary tragedy
of this kingdom. That... is what our
new leaders have told us...
[->]I will quell all unease in my mind...
I must dedicate myself to this kingdom
where my dearest rests in peace...
[->]I hope... that all of our choices can
lead us to finding joy in the end...
[END]
800: (Hope) [7a 8][13 1, 400604][Flynn]... No, that is too
familiar. 'Tis more proper to call you
the warrior of light now.
[->]Demon sightings have been greatly
diminished of late. We will soon stop
sending Samurai across the kingdom.
[->]True peace will at last prevail in our
Eastern Kingdom of Mikado...
[->]Perhaps I may even live to see the
Samurai disbanded...
[END]
900: (Hope) [7a 8][13 1, 400603][Flynn]...
[->]I saw you emerge from Naraku alongside
a flaxen−haired girl.
[->]It was not long after that the horde
of demons surged into our kingdom...
[->]I fear no demon. What I fear, rather,
is the terrible thought growing in my
mind...
[->]Have I... forged the worst threat to
this kingdom with my own hands...?
[END]
1000: (Hope) [7a 8][13 1, 400601][Flynn]... Yes, I've heard it all
from Isabeau...
[->]About God's chariot, and what became
of Jonathan...
[->][Flynn]... This is merely my own
opinion, but growing up means choosing
one's friends.
[->]As your life grows busier, your time to
spend with friends lessens. So you cling
to those you feel comfortable with...
[->]Rather than spend your precious idle
moments with those who do not share
your views.
[->]I may be doing a poor job of explaining
myself... I just wanted to say that you
needn't feel disappointed in yourself.
[END]
