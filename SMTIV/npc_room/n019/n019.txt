0: (Male demonoid) [7a 103][13 1, 415101]Oh, hello, my lovely Intruders. Wha−−
Do you mean ME!?
[->]Come now! You've met me before! I'm the
demonoid from Akira's place.
[->]Well, no offense taken. Demonoids do
look similar to one another.
[END]
1: (Male demonoid) [7a 103][13 1, 415100]Oh, hello, my lovely Intruders. Akira
already told me the whole story.
[->]You whacked Kenji, right? No kidding!?
Then Akira's the new King of Tokyo...
[->]Hurrah for the birth of King Akira...!
[END]
2: (Female neurisher) [7a 147][13 1, 417103]These aren't the only neurishers we've
got, you know. There's also a few
from Kasumigaseki.
[->]Since we have enough to go around,
Akira told us to take turns feeding
the demonoids.
[->]I take the even−numbered days.
You see? Akira's not so bad...
[END]
3: (Female neurisher) [7a 147][13 1, 417102]There are two types of neurishers in
Shinjuku: The ones here from the start,
and those from Kasumigaseki.
[->]Since we have enough to go around,
King Akira told us to take turns
feeding the demonoids.
[->]I take the even−numbered days.
King Akira's a pretty cool guy, huh?
[END]
4: (Male neurisher) [7a 148][13 1, 417003]Around the time Kenji, who'd just become
a demonoid, defeated the demon in
Ichigaya and became King of Tokyo...
[->]He declared that all residents of Tokyo
must choose to become either neurishers
or demonoids.
[->]Kenji's men took all the normal humans
left in Tokyo to Ichigaya...
[->]There, we were forced to undergo
surgery. Of course, he let us choose
which operation we wanted...
[END]
5: (Male neurisher) [7a 148][13 1, 417000]If you've seen Kenji, maybe you've
seen this too...
[->]You went to a lab in Camp Ichigaya,
didn't you? In a way, that was the
birthplace for us all...
[->]Since there are no normal humans left
in Tokyo, that lab will never again
see use, I'm sure...
[END]
6: (Female demonoid) [7a 104][13 1, 417102]This really is Shinjuku, isn't it!? It's
like I'm in a dream! The underground
mall looks like a huge garden...!
[->]The old Shinjuku occupants were so
short−sighted. Our boss chose right!
[END]
7: (Female demonoid) [7a 104][13 1, 417102]This really is Ichigaya, isn't it!? It's
like I'm in a dream! Though the shopping
isn't very good here...
[->]But the defenses are top−notch! It'll
make a great fort for us. Our boss
chose right!
[END]
8: (Male demonoid) [7a 167][13 1, 415006]Huh? The boss!? He's over on the other
side of the shutter... Why?
[->]He's not the kind of guy you can see
without an appointment. Get your ass
home before you get yourself killed.
[END]
9: (Male demonoid) [7a 167][13 1, 412007]We cleaned out all the Shinjuku folks
in this town.
[->]Wouldn't want to get stabbed in the
back, right? Huh...? What do you mean,
my ”fellow demons”?
[->]Listen, friends. Losers get whacked.
That's the only rule here in Tokyo,
you get me?
[END]
10: (Male demonoid) [7a 167][13 1, 412003]Our Kasumigaseki crew has rubbed out
all the old Shinjuku folks.
[->]Wouldn't want to get stabbed in the
back, right? Huh...? What do you mean,
my ”fellow demons”?
[->]Listen, friends. Losers get whacked.
That's the only rule here in Tokyo,
you get me?
[END]
11: (Male demonoid) [7a 167][13 1, 412003]Our Kasumigaseki crew has already rubbed
out all the old Shinjuku folks.
[->]Wouldn't want to get stabbed in the
back, right? Huh...? What do you mean,
my ”fellow demons”?
[->]Listen, friends. Losers get whacked.
That's the only rule here in Tokyo,
you get me?
[END]
12: (Akira) [7a 85][13 1, 401701]Oh, my dear masters! I thought you had
all gone back to your own world!
[->]I'm going to Ichigaya. A king should
sit at his throne, you know?
[->]When my sis died, I craved the power
to fight... so I became a demonoid.
[->]But in the end, I realized how
important the order is... It was
a little disappointing, sure, but...
[->]Look, don't worry about this world,
okay? The King of Tokyo's got it all
under control!
[END]
100: (Male demonoid) [7a 103][13 1, 415101]What's this foul smell...? It smells
like garbage... Oh, why it's Akira
the scavenger, isn't it?
[->]You did get permission from the guard
to weasel in here, right? If not, I'll
snap you right in half, you hear?
[END]
101: (Male demonoid) [7a 103][13 1, 415100]Hello, my lovely Intruders! Akira's the
bona fide King of Tokyo now, you know.
[->]Although... compared to Kenji, the old
king, he doesn't pack much of a punch
at all. I feel sorry for him.
[->]Nevertheless... Hurrah for the birth of
King Akira...!
[END]
103: (Female neurisher) [7a 147][13 1, 417102]There are two types of neurishers in
Shinjuku: The ones here from the start,
and those from Kasumigaseki.
[->]Since we have enough to go around,
King Akira told us to take turns

[->]I take the even−numbered days.
You know... I wouldn't mind dating
King Akira, if he asked...
[END]
105: (Male neurisher) [7a 148][13 1, 417000]This is just a rumor... But I heard
there was a baby born in Kasumigaseki?
[->]So... what do you think it'll grow up
to be? A demonoid? Or a neurisher...?
[->]I guess we can let him decide for
himself down the line. Maybe he'll even
have a chance to stay normal...
[END]
201: (Female neurisher) [7a 147][13 1, 417103]Huh? You're from Kasumigaseki? You mean
you're from Akira's sorry crew...?
[->]I feel sorry for the neurishers stuck
with those losers.
[->]They probably never get a moment's rest,
since such a tiny, weak crew can't
possibly own many neurishers...
[END]
203: (Male neurisher) [7a 148][13 1, 417003]I know it was my own decision, but
becoming a neurisher was such a
terrible idea...
[->]I feel like a cow or something... Only
alive to feed those above me on the
food chain...
[->]Sometimes I wonder what life would be
like if I'd chosen differently at
Ichigaya that day...
[END]
205: (Female demonoid) [7a 168][13 1, 417104]Say, Akira, who's that you have there
with you? Huh? Intruders...?
[->]...Gimme a break. They're probably
just neurishers with some nifty toys
they found somewhere, right?
[->]Why are you so desperate to entertain
us? Geez.
[END]
