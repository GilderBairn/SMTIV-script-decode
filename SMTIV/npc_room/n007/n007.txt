0: (Tough woman) [7a 98][13 1, 403341]You guys seem like you know how to
fight. Why not help out our association?
[->]I know Tokyo's a mess, but it's where
we've got to live. Like we have a
choice, right?
[END]
2: (Tough woman) [7a 98][13 1, 403302]You guys beat Pluto, right? Then why
not help out our association too?
[->]I know Tokyo's a mess, but it's where
we've got to live. Like we have a
choice, right?
[END]
3: (Hunter) [7a 99][13 1, 403042]Kiyoharu? I dunno. I thought he was
with Akira.
[->]Those two go way back to when they used
to fight demons together.
[END]
4: (Hunter) [7a 99][13 1, 403012]Kiyoharu and Akira got infected by
Pluto's poison.
[->]It was when the demons first appeared
all over Tokyo. They were fighting in
Shinjuku and got into a battle outside.
[->]If Kiyoharu and Akira were in better
shape, they might stand a chance at
beating Pluto.
[END]
5: (Hunter man) [7a 162][13 1, 403002]After God brought down his wrath, we
decided to stay in this shelter.
[->]We spent 25 years here, eating all
the food stockpiled in the joint,
little by little...
[->]I still remember the pit in my stomach
when I first set foot outside. Our
Tokyo... it was just a huge desert...
[END]
6: (Hunter man) [7a 162][13 1, 403031]If I had to sum up the last 25 years
in one word, it'd be ”despair.” But the
one thing I've learned...
[->]It'd be the fact that despair gets you
nowhere. I know that deep inside now...
[->]And I have you to thank for it. You
got rid of Pluto for us...
[END]
7: (Hunter woman) [7a 100][13 1, 403142]I heard Akira had a sister who got
separated from him when they were kids.
[->]She was taken sky high in the Angel's
Cocoon...
[END]
8: (Hunter woman) [7a 100][13 1, 403133]Thanks for accepting Akira's request.
But damn... you really beat Pluto...
[->]Well, hell, don't just stand there.
Go give him the good news!
[END]
9: (Hunter woman) [7a 100][13 1, 403141]Akira was telling me you're from the
Eastern Kingdom of Mikado?
[->]He said he's gonna use that demon from
Ichigaya and restore Tokyo.
[->]That's some idea, huh? Well, it's cool
with me. I'm pretty good at controlling
demons myself.
[END]
10: (Hermit woman) [7a 98][13 1, 403321]Hey, you've got to keep those goggles
on tight! Don't fiddle with them!
[END]
11: (Hazard−suited child) [7a 95][13 1, 404012]But I hate them! They hurt my eyes!
The bad monster's gone now, right?
Then how come...
[END]
12: (Hermit woman) [7a 98][13 1, 403302]Yes, the bad monster's dead, but Tokyo
is still dirty. It won't be clean again
for a while.
[->]So please be patient, okay?
[END]
14: (Stiff woman) [7a 163][13 1, 403312]Sorry to break up the good mood...
[->]But even if Pluto is dead, his poison
is sticking around...
[->]And if it infects you, nothing can save
you then.
[END]
15: (Stiff woman) [7a 163][13 1, 403312]Even if Pluto is dead, his poison is
sticking around...
[->]So it's a race against time... Can we
establish the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado
before Akira's time runs out?
[->]God knows what'll happen now...
[END]
109: (Hunter woman) [7a 100][13 1, 403141]That idea about using demons to restore
Tokyo... It's actually not gonna be so
easy, you know...
[->]Not the work itself. But training a
demon to do it...
[->]With Tokyo how it is, I can't really
give them decent rewards. But I can't
just give them sticks either, right?
[END]
