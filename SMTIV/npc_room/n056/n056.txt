0: (Walter) [7a 4][13 1, 400203]Demons were no mere fairy−stories
after all...
[->]The aching wound on my shoulder, the
taste of blood on my tongue... These are
too real for any fairy−story.
[->]If they come at me with the intent to
kill, then I'll respond in kind.
[END]
1: (Navarre) [7a 6][13 1, 400401]...Gwah!?
[->]O−Oh, it's you... I thought you to be
a demon. Don't startle me so...
[->]I've never carried a blade any heavier
than a knife before.
[->]If Mother were to see me dashing about
with such a weapon in hand, I think
that she would faint...
[END]
2: (Nosy Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 404301]Hoy there. I've heard the rumors...
They say you acquitted yourself well
in the training exercises.
[->]But we have a saying: one's reach should
not exceed one's grasp. Strive for too
much, and you could lose all.
[END]
3: (Nosy Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 404303]Hasn't it been one problem after the next
this year? Ever since you new prentices
joined our ranks...
[->]Could it be that in a past life, as
some would have it, you did something
blasphemous? Ah, but I jest.
[END]
4: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 114]...Yes, but are we not all members of
the same order? I can see no need to be
unnecessarily modest.
[END]
5: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403203]The Samurai who are not yet convinced
have gone to petition Abbot Hugo.
[->]Thanks to our Commander's intervention,
nothing went seriously wrong...
[->]Remember that this is Abbot Hugo we're
speaking of. The dissenters could have
found themselves on the block.
[END]
6: (Angel) [7a 65462][13 1, 483002]We have created a false space within the
boundary of the Unclean Ones' influence.
[->]I am nearly certain that no demon will
be capable of passing through it to
reach us here...
[->]Not a single one of the Filth shall be
allowed to taint the kingdom that the
Lord has made.
[END]
100: (Walter) [7a 4][13 1, 400202]”Compete against each other”? This is
no village wrestling contest, I hope
he realizes.
[->]For us to be in such grave peril, while
that Hope... He's taken leave of his
senses.
[->]Small wonder he commands the Samurai,
eh...?
[END]
101: (Navarre) [7a 6][13 1, 400404]During the first quest, I landed a
critical blow when I accidentally
tripped...
[->]The next quest was simpler, since as you
might expect, money is no object to me.
'Twas actually easier than the first.
[->]But the final challenge all depends on
one's strength, and that's a field I'm
particularly lacking in...
[->]S−Someone else may have first place,
I care not whom. Merely let this debacle
of a training exercise be done with!
[END]
102: (Nosy Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 404301]You look unwell... Is there something
troubling you?
[->]Don't tell me... has a fellow of ours
gone missing? No, 'twas merely baseless
suspicion. Pay me no mind.
[END]
104: (気難しいサムライ) [7a 114][13 1, 403242]納得できないサムライ衆の面々が
ウーゴ殿の元へ抗議に向かったそうだ
[->]お頭の仲介で
大事にならずに済んだけど…
[->]…下手したらウーゴ殿のことだ
抗議した連中 処刑されたかもしれんぞ…
[END]
200: (Walter) [7a 4][13 1, 400204]Hoy, brother.
[->]I don't seriously intend to do Navarre
any harm, so be at ease on that score.
[->]But... ever since I was young, my lowly
birth, my inexperience, my weakness has
been used as a cudgel against me.
[->]I seethe inside to hear people say such
things while hiding behind their sad
excuses...
[END]
201: (ナバール) [7a 6][13 1, 400402][先/さき]の[実地/じっち][訓練/くんれん]では[不覚/ふかく]を[取/と]ったが
[今度/こんど]こそ[私/わたし]が[勝/か]つ…ッ
[->][君/きみ]もこんな[所/ところ]で[油/あぶら]を[売/う]ってないで
クエストに[励/はげ]むべきじゃないのかね?
[END]
202: (Nosy Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 404321]What will I do with that Navarre...?
At the very least, he must be made to
pay the request's reward.
[->]...Oh, it's nothing. I was merely
muttering to myself. I am glad, though,
to hear that Navarre is safe.
[END]
204: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403241]...What is it, prentice? 'Tis not my
role to give guidance to fledgling
Samurai.
[->]But since you've come this far, I am
willing to share a few truths, if you
are of a mind to hear them.
[END]
300: (Walter) [7a 4][13 1, 400201]The essence of battling demons is thus:
[->]You must strike at your enemy's weakness,
while taking care that they do not strike
your own.
[->]And as for your fellow... er, I mean,
your demons, you need a number of them
to face the enemy...
[->]Now that I think on it, it's something
I've done since I was a boy.
[END]
304: Ask him to tell you
Decline his offer
[END]
400: (Navarre) [7a 6][13 1, 400454]Hello, Casularies. You must be ahead of
the game if you have time to dilly−
dally so.
[END]
404: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 114]Mystic relics can be excavated at the
same location many times, endlessly.
[->]For reasons unknown, the same relic may
appear again after some time has passed.
They are mystic indeed...
[->]Once you have excavated a relic, you may
wish to return to the site later and try
your hand at it again.
[END]
500: (Navarre) [7a 6]I, meanwhile, have already completed
the first Challenge Quest.
[END]
504: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 114]...Of course. I'm sorry to disturb you
during your training.
[END]
600: (Navarre) [7a 6]I, for my part, have already completed
two of the Challenge Quests.
[END]
700: (Navarre) [7a 6]I'm presently at work on the third
Challenge Quest... and very close to
completing it, I'll have you know.
[END]
800: (Navarre) [7a 6]I may very well be the victor in our
little contest.
[END]
