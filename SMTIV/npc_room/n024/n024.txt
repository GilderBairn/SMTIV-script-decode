0: (Meek Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403001]Oh, my dear fellow Samurai... Do you
recognize me? I've seen you many a
time in Naraku.
[->]Operating the elevator proved to be a
challenge, but I, too, have at last
arrived in Tokyo!
[->]I was so lonely in this unknown land...
I am most relieved to see a few
familiar faces.
[END]

in Tokyo as well, I see.

mystic relics.

Samurai you will see here...

soon be returning to Mikado Castle.

He seemed a bit panicked... I wonder
what might have happened.
[END]
3: (Meek Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403042]I can feel my heart swell with hope
merely by looking at you...

know it's too soon to abandon all hope.
[END]

mean by that!?
[END]
5: (Meek Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403002]The people of the Eastern Kingdom of
Mikado are gathering in Shinjuku now.

should head there straightaway.
[END]
6: (Hunter woman) [7a 70][13 1, 403141]Are you a Hunter? Eh, doesn't matter.
[->]You're young and healthy. You oughtta
do some quests.
[->]Tokyo is packed with demons as it is,
so it's always good to have people who
can fight around.
[->]But if you're going to get yourself
killed, please die close to the city.
That way we can scavenge your stuff...
[END]

11: (Hunter woman) [7a 70][13 1, 403141]I didn't expect Yuriko to make the
first strike. I guess her silence so far
was just the calm before the storm...
[->]It's just a matter of time before the
fighting spills over into the other
regions. Soon, Tokyo'll be up in flames.
[->]Well, if you're going to get yourself
killed, please die near the Ueno area.
Makes it easier on us scavengers...
