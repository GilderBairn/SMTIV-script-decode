0: (Heavyset man) [7a 121][13 1, 403002]Are you taking on quests for the
Ashura−kai...?
[->]I don't care what your reasons are.
You're helping those dirty kidnappers.
[->]......
Maybe I've said too much. You'll
see what I mean soon enough.
[END]
1: (Heavyset man) [7a 121][13 1, 403002]In that moment when the light shined
from Ichigaya, I saw a human−shaped
figure.
[->]A white figure... It reminded me of
my daughter...
[->]When I blinked, it was gone...
[END]
2: (Heavyset man) [7a 121][13 1, 403021]I just saw two shadows...
...Two white shadows...
[->]Somehow, they... They reminded me
of my wife and daughter.
[->]They asked me to join them.
They said that things will be very
hard for me here soon...
[->]Without thinking, I said that I'd
keep trying to do my best. Then they
said, ”Farewell...”
[END]
3: (Icy−eyed woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403311]You know, I once worked in a club in
Ginza. Tayama used to go there often.
[->]He's kinda handsome, and a smooth
talker. When he put his moves on
the ladies, he rarely left alone...
[->]But I hear that he bosses everyone
around now. Well, technically, he
is the boss of Tokyo, so...
[END]
4: (Icy−eyed woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403311]Come to think of it, nothing big has
really happened in Tokyo for years...
[->]The children who came from above
the ceiling drove Tayama and Lady
Yuriko into a massive war...
[->]They have changed Tokyo...
[END]
5: (冷めた目の女) [7a 123][13 1, 403311]ああ…とうとう[発電炉/はつでんろ]を[巡/めぐ]って
[戦争/せんそう]が[始/はじ]まったのね…[誰/だれ]かのせいで
[END]
6: (Icy−eyed woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403302]Ever since I saw you, Tokyo's been
going through big changes.
[->]I'm worried about what the demons are
going to do... but I'm more worried
about you.
[->]Do you intend to save Tokyo?
Or are you planning to destroy it?
[END]
7: (Icy−eyed woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403302]After you came through the ceiling
to Tokyo, the city has changed.
You have changed it.
[->]Do you intend to save Tokyo?
Or are you planning to destroy it?
[->]By the way, aren't you rated in the
top three in Tokyo? Why don't you
use this power to save us?
[END]
8: (Icy−eyed woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403312]Hey, it's you... You're the one who
came in from above...
[->]Tokyo hadn't changed much in the
past couple of years... And then
you came along.
[->]What exactly are you going to do to
Tokyo? You don't seem to want to
destroy it...
[END]
9: (Icy−eyed woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403302]Hey, it's you... You're the one who
came in from above...
[->]Tokyo hadn't changed much in the
past couple of years... And then
you came along.
[->]No. It didn't really change. You've
just restored the city into what it
once was...
[END]
10: (Fierce man) [7a 60][13 1, 403202]I might not look it, but I used to be
a master chef at a famous sushi bar
in Ginza before Tokyo was covered up.
[->]That Tayama was such a small fry that
he wouldn't even have gotten in the
door to my joint.
[->]I mean, I've got pride. I would
never live under his protection.
[END]
11: (Fierce man) [7a 60][13 1, 403212]Tayama wants us to live together
with the demons by using the Reds...
[->]Yuriko says that we need to get
stronger so that we can live on
equal footing with the demons...
[->]What the hell? Aren't they both
saying the same thing, pretty much?
[END]
12: (凄みのある男) [7a 60][阿修羅会/あしゅらかい]が[幅/はば]を[利/き]かせてるせいで

[俺/おれ]は[大歓迎/だいかんげい]だぜッ
[END]
13: (Fierce man) [7a 60][13 1, 403202]Tayama and Yuriko, sworn enemies...
They're no longer in Tokyo.
[->]Tayama wanted us to live together
with the demons by using the Reds...
[->]Yuriko said that we need to get
stronger so that we can live on
equal footing with the demons...
[->]...Aren't those essentially the same
goal? I'm not missing something, am I?
[END]
14: (凄みのある男) [7a 60][総合/そうごう]ランキングとは ハンター[商会/しょうかい]も
また[変/へん]な[企画/きかく][始/はじ]めたモンだな

[END]
15: (Fierce man) [7a 60][13 1, 403202]Tayama wanted us to live together
with the demons by using the Reds...
[->]Yuriko said that we need to get
stronger so that we can live on
equal footing with the demons...
[->]But the people decided to follow the
champion, instead... People will
choose who they want to be led by.
[END]
16: (凄みのある男) [7a 60][13 1, 403641][誰/だれ]かが[天使/てんし][軍/ぐん]を[始末/しまつ]したんだとさ

[END]
17: (Fierce man) [7a 60][13 1, 403202]Tayama wanted us to live together
with the demons by using the Reds...
[->]Yuriko said that we need to get
stronger so that we can live on
equal footing with the demons...
[->]But you proposed something else.
[->]Instead, you've given us hope.
And that hope is stronger than the
demons...
[END]
18: (Sallow man) [7a 79][13 1, 403642]I hear there's a special members−only
shop in downtown Ginza.
[->]That place only sells really
expensive stuff. Of course, I've
never set foot in there.
[->]But I guess that people who will
spend money in places like that are
called ”celebrities”...
[END]
100: (Heavyset man) [7a 121][13 1, 403002]...You're headed for the area below
Roppongi, huh? Then you're sure to
see that thing...
[->]I read an article about the
Ashura−kai's kidnapping operations
several years ago.
[->]...That place is no longer the
Roppongi Hills. It's Roppongi Hell.
[END]
101: (Heavyset man) [7a 121][13 1, 403002]In that moment when the light shined
from Ichigaya, I saw a human−shaped
figure.
[->]A white figure... It reminded me of
my daughter...
[->]...She was taken by angels...
[END]
103: (Icy−eyed woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403311]You know, I once worked in a club in
Ginza. Tayama used to go there often.
[->]He always got a lot of attention from
women, but because of his attitude,
none of his relationships worked out.
[->]Perhaps the reason why he's accepting
this challenge from Yuriko is because
he can't stand a woman with attitude.
[END]
200: (Heavyset man) [7a 121][13 1, 403002]If you are visiting Camp Ichigaya,
I'm sure you will see that thing
there...
[->]A long time ago, I read an article
saying that that's where the fine
line between humans and demons is...
[->]It's the very edge.
[END]
201: (Heavyset man) [7a 121][13 1, 403002]In that moment when the light shined
from Ichigaya, I saw a human−shaped
figure.
[->]A white figure... It reminded me of
my wife...
[->]My wife was killed by demons when we
were running away from Ichigaya...
