0: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 53][13 1, 404303]If you succeeded in making it here,
it means you have shown us that you
do have strength...
[->]...Welcome to Ginza. The Ring of Gaea
welcomes all who have power.
[END]
1: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 53][13 1, 404303]No matter what end Lady Yuriko has
met, we will not give up our belief
that might makes right.
[->]If you see what has happened as a
victory, then you truly are a fool.
[->]Lady Yuriko left us with one more
prophecy. Ha ha...
[END]
2: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 53][13 1, 404332]Ah, fellow members of the Ring of
Gaea. You have received Lady Yuriko's
blessing, have you not?
[->]You ”children of carnage” have
decended from the Firmament. May you
create a world for humans in Tokyo...
[->]One where men and demons are bound
by laws of power, and not by Reds.
[END]
3: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 53][13 1, 404331]Fools... Fellow members of the
Ring of Gaea, yet have been bewitched
by angels...
[->]Lady Yuriko left us with one last
prophecy. Ha ha...
[->]”The child of carnage shall be
devoured, and the Demon Lord will be
resurrected.” It has come to pass!
[END]
4: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 53][13 1, 404331]Great One, fellow member of the Ring
of Gaea, and resenter of God...
[->]Lady Yuriko left us with one last
prophecy. Ha ha...
[->]”The child of carnage shall be
devoured, and the Demon Lord will be
resurrected.” It has come to pass!
[END]
5: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 53][13 1, 404331]I will acknowledge your power.
...[Flynn], was it?
[->]Your power could not exist without
the hard work of your teammates.
[->]Do not forget that all the glory
that you bask in rests on the
shoulders of your demons.
[END]
6: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 54][13 1, 404403]I would give my life for Lady Yuriko.
But is anyone willing to die for
Tayama?
[->]The only reason anyone follows
Tayama is because he controls the
electricity.
[->]Those without power lack natural
magnetism. That is why they use
objects to gain the loyalty of others.
[END]
7: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 54][13 1, 404403]Lady Yuriko told us this:
[->]The child of carnage enthralled by
the witch of the night shall open
the gate once again...
[->]The child of carnage should already
have headed out. The Yamato Reactor
awaits.
[END]
8: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 54][13 1, 404403]It's just as Lady Yuriko told us.
[->]The child of carnage enthralled by
the witch of the night shall open
the gate once again...
[->]Now, children of carnage...
To the Yamato Reactor!
[END]
9: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 54][13 1, 404412]It's just as Lady Yuriko told us.
[->]The child of carnage that abandoned
God has opened the gate once again...
And the demons have been released.
[->]Even though Lady Yuriko is no more,
she is still our hope!
[END]
10: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 54][13 1, 404412]I will not allow myself to be led
astray by this ”hope” the common
people speak of!
[->]The only truth is in Lady Yuriko's
words! The gate has been opened once
again, and the demons are released.
[->]Even though Lady Yuriko is no more,
she is still our path to greatness!
[END]
11: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 54][13 1, 404431]I will not allow myself to be led
astray by this ”hope” the common
people speak of!
[->]The only truth is in Lady Yuriko's
words! The gate has been opened once
again, and the Demon Lord returns.
[->]Even though Lady Yuriko is no more,
she is still our path to greatness!
[END]
12: (ガイア教団の女) [7a 54][13 1, 404431][体/からだ]を[縛/しば]る[阿修羅会/あしゅらかい]も
[頭/あたま]を[押/お]さえる[天使/てんし]も[消/き]えた
[->]さあ [自由/じゆう]を[謳歌/おうか]しようではないか…
[END]
13: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 54][13 1, 404442]When I was younger, I never conceived
that demons would appear in Tokyo.
[->]But Lady Yuriko once said that humans
and demons are one and the same...
[->]Even though Lady Yuriko is no more,
she is still our hope!
[END]
14: (Hunter man) [7a 118][13 1, 403002]I passed by Tsukiji Hongwanji a moment
ago, but it's oddly quiet there. Isn't
there supposed to be a war there soon?
[->]Perhaps something happened to Lady
Yuriko...? No, that's impossible.
[END]
15: (Hunter man) [7a 118][13 1, 403002]I passed by Tsukiji Hongwanji a moment
ago, but it's oddly quiet there. Isn't
there supposed to be a war there soon?
[->]The place felt like the outcome had
already been determined.
[END]
16: (Hunter man) [7a 118][13 1, 403002]All this ”Champion” stuff is bullshit.
I'm supposed to put doing quests
over my own safety?
[->]Anybody who would go out and do that
kind of thing is just a champion
idiot, if you ask me.
[END]
17: (Hunter man) [7a 118][13 1, 403002]All this ”Champion” stuff is bullshit.
I'm supposed to put doing quests
over my own safety?
[->]...But there are a lot of people
starting to fall for this crap.
[END]
18: (Hunter man) [7a 118][13 1, 403002]All this ”Champion” stuff is bullshit.
I'm supposed to put doing quests
over my own safety?
[->]...Or so I thought. Then I learned
more about the guy who won the title.
He's amazing.
[->]Yeah... I really look up to you,
Champion.
[END]
19: (Hunter man) [7a 118][13 1, 403002]All this ”Champion” stuff is bullshit.
I'm supposed to put doing quests
over my own safety?
[->]...Or so I thought. Then I learned
more about the guy who won the title.
He's amazing.
[->]It's probably because of someone like
you that Masakado decided to help you.
[END]
20: (Hunter man) [7a 118][13 1, 403002]You even defeated that Demon Lord
thing! Nobody could possibly stand
up to you now.
[->]Plus, you're the Champion, and the
new guardian of Tokyo...
[->]Your name's practically a killing
word, now. You'd better make sure
you don't get taken advantage of.
[END]
100: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 53][13 1, 404303]...What? Lady Yuriko was a demon
named Lilith...?
[->]It doesn't matter who she is.
She has proven that she has power.
[->]The Ring of Gaea respects one's
strength more than one's heritage.
[END]
104: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 53][13 1, 404331]You... You're the one who joined us
as a member of the Ring of Gaea, and
yet did not accept demons.
[->]Lady Yuriko left us with one last
prophecy. Ha ha...
[->]”The child of carnage shall be
devoured, and the Demon Lord will be
resurrected.” It has come to pass!
[END]
106: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 54][13 1, 404403]Lady Yuriko told us this:
[->]Those who accept God's curse will
surrender to the rule of the strong.
[->]When that happens, Tokyo will be
reborn!
[END]
204: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 53][13 1, 404331]I will acknowledge your power.
...[Flynn], was it?
[->]But the Ring of Gaea does not look
favorably on those in Tokyo who rely
on your strength for their survival.
[->]If you are drunk on the praise of
such people, then I suggest you
clear your head, and soon.
[END]
206: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 54][13 1, 404403]Lady Yuriko told us this:
[->]Those chosen by God will awaken to the
rule of the strong and become the
”children of carnage...”
[->]When that happens, Tokyo will be
reborn!
[END]
