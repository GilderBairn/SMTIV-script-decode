0: (Simple man) [7a 34][13 1, 403202]The Eastern Kingdom of Mikado is fine as
ever. Work is going well, no changes from
yesterday.
[->]I thank God and our king for granting
us such a wonderful day.
[END]
1: (Simple man) [7a 34][13 1, 403242]I should see to my usual routine. I must
thank God and the king, and then...
[->]I'll continue where I left off in my
book. Ahhh, another sleepless night
in store for me, I see...
[END]
2: (Simple man) [7a 34][13 1, 403222]*yawn* I'm so sleepy. I'm so engrossed
in these mystery novels that I can't
put them down...
[->]Maybe I can go lightly on the job
today... I'm sure God and the king
will forgive me.
[->]After all, it's not as if the Luxurors
do any work either...
[END]
3: (Simple man) [7a 34][13 1, 403222]An odd thing: that mystery novel I was
reading had disappeared when I returned
home from the public execution.
[->]Well, no sense in pining after what's
gone. I think I'll begin a new book
instead.
[->]Ah yes, there was that one I got at the
Sabbath in Cat's Cheek called ”Paradise
Lost”...
[END]
4: (Simple man) [7a 34][13 1, 403202]The Eastern Kingdom of Mikado is fine as
ever. Work is going well, no changes from
yesterday.
[->]I thank God and our king for granting
us such a wonderful day.
[->]Huh? Books...? What're you talking about?
Even if I did have the time to read,
I'd rather spend it working.
[END]
5: (Simple man) [7a 34][13 1, 403202]The Eastern Kingdom of Mikado is fine as
ever. Work is going well, no changes from
yesterday.
[->]I thank God and our king for granting
us such a wonderful day.
[->]Huh? Books...? Oh, I threw those away.
My role's to work, not to read.
[END]
6: (Simple man) [7a 34][13 1, 403202]The Eastern Kingdom of Mikado is fine as
ever. But is that coming to an end?
[->]When we move to the new world, who'll
give me my usual day? My role in life?
[->]I−I'm... not so keen on going to this
new world...
[END]
7: (Reeking man) [7a 35][13 1, 403032]I haven't seen your face around here.
Which village are you−−
[->]Oh, yes, the Rite. Is it that time of
year again already...?
[END]
8: (Reeking man) [7a 35][13 1, 403032]...Hoy, I remember you. Look what a fine
man you've become.
[->]Don't I recall another young lad with
you? Where's he gone...?
[END]
9: (Reeking man) [7a 35][13 1, 403032]I went outside to relieve myself and
saw that the sky over Kiccigiorgi was
bright red...
[->]I talked with the young lad who was with
you on the day of the Rite.
[->]He said he was from Kiccigiorgi. I hope
he was all right...
[END]
10: (Reeking man) [7a 35][13 1, 403032]They called it a festival, so you can
imagine my surprise to find myself at
an execution.
[->]According to the Monastery, there are
demons in this kingdom? And an evildoer
changing people into demons...?
[->]Well, all's well that ends well, eh?
Nothing will change for us, right...?
[END]
11: (Reeking man) [7a 35][13 1, 403032]Hoy, did you hear? There was no fire at
Kiccigiorgi... it was a demon attack!
[->]The Monastery is playing the Casualries
for fools! They keep us ignorant for
their own purposes!
[->]Well, from now on, the kingdom's under
new management. So all's well that
ends well.
[END]
12: (Reeking man) [7a 35][13 1, 403032]I learned from the new leaders that
demons are no simple fairy−stories...
[->]Under the new leadership, the Monastery
has brought everything to light.
[->]Thank you for all you did on our behalf
while we labored in darkness...
Blessed Samurai.
[END]
13: (Reeking man) [7a 35][13 1, 403032]Supposedly, the Monastery was ordered
by our new leaders to tell us everything.
[->]Demons aren't fairy−stories at all.
You've been fighting this whole time
while we toiled in darkness, yes?
[->]This may be a bit late in coming...
but thank you, Blessed Samurai.
[END]
14: (Frugal woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403303]It's thanks to the Luxurors that we in
the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado can live
in peace.
[->]King Ahazuya of Mikado and the monks of
the Monastery... I pray every day in the
castle's direction to show my thanks.
[END]
15: (Frugal woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403303]I don't recall who told me this... but
supposedly, demons are indeed real.
[->]But in any case, we have the Luxurors
with us.
[->]I'm sure I don't know what they would
do for us exactly, but I'm sure it
would keep us safe!
[END]
16: (Frugal woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403302]E−Erm, demons aren't truly real, are
they? I'll grant you that everyone has
been talking about them...
[->]And that rare disease that turns humans
into frightful creatures cropping up
in the west of the kingdom...
[->]Pray, what are the Luxurors doing about
this? We will be safe, no...?
[END]
17: (Frugal woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403312]I'm dreadfully glad that the Black
Samurai has been executed...
[->]Praise be to the Samurai and Monastery
who brought this about!
[->]I knew that we could trust our Luxurors.
They always have our interests at heart,
bless them...!
[END]
18: (Frugal woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403312]I can't abide those Luxurors. To think
that they were just using us...!
[->]They produce nothing, and yet they
consume the food we bring to them...
[->]If our new leaders had not told us about
this, we would have been their slaves
until our dying day!
[END]
19: (Frugal woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403344]Our new leaders have said that the food
we produce is rightly ours.
[->]That alone makes life in the Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado easier on us. Praise
be to God and our new leaders!
[->]May this ideal state of things last as
long as it can...
[END]
20: (Frugal woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403344]The advent of our new leaders has made
life in the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado
much easier on us.
[->]But this new world the Blessed Samurai
coax us to, even if it means discarding
all of that...
[->]I'm anxious about departing on such a
journey... but my faith in the Samurai
will not waver now!
[END]
21: (Demon) [7a 65225][13 1, 411007]I swear, the people in this country...
Are they nuts!? C'mon, look at me!
I'm a frickin' demon, y'know?
[->]But all they do when they see me is
scream and whimper God's name. They
don't even try to run!
[->]And that ain't no fun at all! The
thrill of the hunt is in the chase!
[END]
22: (Guiding Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403002]There are some who are opposed to the
idea of moving to a new land...
[->]But all it took was the mention of
your name to convince them and stop
their grumbling.
[->]It crossed my mind at such times that
God is a necessary evil to keep the
people in line... 
[END]
23: (Patrolling Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]We considered bringing the pigs along
with us to Tokyo...
[->]But in the end, we had to preserve most
of them in salt and let the people
bring them that way.
[->]They made the ultimate sacrifice for us.
It reminds us how precarious our
situation is.
[->]We must not forget all that. We must
stay humble in the new world...
[END]
102: (Simple man) [7a 34][13 1, 403222]The Monastery has forbidden us to read
books. They say it is to prevent them
from hindering our work.
[->]But if they are no hindrance, then I
must assume it's fine. I see no need
to stop reading books.
[->]If they mean to forbid something, they
should look to those layabout Luxurors
first...
[END]
103: (Simple man) [7a 34][13 1, 403222]Ah, dear me... This ”Paradise Lost”
I got from the Black Samurai is too
fascinating!
[->]It's about a fallen angel, cast out from
Paradise for choosing freedom over
serving his creator.
[->]I never considered the idea that my life
might belong to me. No one ever suggested
anything like it all this time...
[END]
108: (Reeking man) [7a 35][13 1, 403032]...Hoy, I remember you. Look what a fine
man you've become.
[->]Say, that young lad who was with you...
I saw him this morning.
[->]Bound for Lake Mikado, it looked like.
[END]
109: (Reeking man) [7a 35][13 1, 403032]Kiccigiorgi's in a terrible state...
[->]The whole village and the parts around
it are quarantined. All the folk there
were uprooted to nearby villages...
[->]The Monastery said there was a wildfire
out that way, but this seems too extreme
for that to be true.
[END]
116: (Frugal woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403302]That rare disease which turns people to
demons is becoming less rare. It seems
to have had its start in Kiccigiorgi.
[->]I hear that's why the Monastery made
the decision to burn the village down.
[->]E−Erm, our home will be safe, no? I mean,
the Luxurors are working at it, surely?
[END]
202: (Simple man) [7a 34][13 1, 403222]There was a message from the Monastery.
It seems there's to be a gathering at
the castle today.
[->]And just as my mystery novel was
becoming exciting...
[->]But it'll make trouble for me if I don't
go. I suppose I can show my face there
and then slip out quietly.
[END]
209: (Reeking man) [7a 35][13 1, 403032]Looks like a festival today. Isn't that
a bit cheeky at a time like this?
[->]There's Kiccigiorgi folk who still
don't have roofs over their heads...
[END]
