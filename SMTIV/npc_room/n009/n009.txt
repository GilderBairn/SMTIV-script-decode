0: (Hermit man) [7a 97][13 1, 403212]Kiyoharu had a very hard time of it
in this shelter, just after God's
wrath rained down.
[->]Since his friend allied with the angels
to defeat the demons, there was no one
to stop God...
[->]And in the end, His wrath came down...
[->]Kiyoharu must've felt responsible. He
kept praying to God, even while everyone
mocked him for it.
[->]He was your age when all that started.
No wonder he looks the way he does
now, eh?
[END]
1: (Hermit man) [7a 97][13 1, 403202]Kiyoharu told us Pluto is dead!
[->]He said he just sensed it. Only Kiyoharu
could do something like that...
[->]He was running around inside the
shelter. Seemed so happy.
[END]
2: (Hermit man) [7a 97][13 1, 403202]Everyday, we have a series of meetings
with Akira. The time flies around here.
[->]But keeping busy makes me feel like
we're getting somewhere, you know?
So it's not so bad.
[END]
3: (Downtrodden man) [7a 162][13 1, 403242]I remember... There were guys who
worshipped demons...
[->]I know now that there is no God. If
those guys asked, I would probably
follow them...
[END]
4: (Downtrodden man) [7a 162][13 1, 403242]Hmm... Pluto's dead, huh? One less
headache, I guess.
[->]But we're still loaded with chores.
Ain't got time to blame God.
[END]
5: (Downtrodden man) [7a 162][13 1, 403242]I know the idea of the Eastern Kingdom
of Mikado is important, but we also
need guys who can fight.
[->]There's more and more demons all the
time now. Geez... we don't even have
time to curse God, you know?
[END]
6: (Hunter woman) [7a 100][13 1, 403103]The place we call Pluto Castle is to
the southeast from here. Go over the
bridge there and you'll see it.
[->]You'll know it when you see a domeâˆ’
shaped building with horns.
[END]
7: (Hunter woman) [7a 100][13 1, 403103]So Pluto Castle's still standing, even
after its master is dead...
[->]I still feel like God has abandoned us.
I guess we're on our own no matter how
far we go...
[END]
8: (Hunter woman) [7a 100][13 1, 403133]So Pluto Castle's still standing, even
after its master is dead... Heh, why
wouldn't it?
[->]I still feel like God has abandoned us.
I guess we're on our own no matter how
far we go...
[END]
9: (Akira) [7a 84][13 1, 401601]We've always imagined God as something
that's good for our cause...
[->]So maybe killing Pluto is going against
His will.
[->]But think about it... Doesn't it make
you mad? All I want is to fight back.
Give Him a firm answer.
[->]I'm counting on you about this Pluto
thing. The remote'll be your reward...
[END]
10: (Akira) [7a 84][13 1, 401601]By the way, you released the people in
Shibuya, right?
[->]Can't say I approve of your unauthorized
use of a Terminal, but...
[->]You made everyone's dreams come true.
From the bottom of my heart, thank you
for that.
[END]
11: (Tough woman) [7a 98][13 1, 403333]You guys beat Pluto, right? Then why
not help out our association too?
[->]I know Tokyo's a mess, but it's where
we've got to live.
[END]
12: (Tough woman) [7a 98][13 1, 403333]You guys seem like you know how to
fight. Why not help out our association?
[->]I know Tokyo's a mess, but it's where
we've got to live.
[END]
