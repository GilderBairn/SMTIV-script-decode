0: (Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403001]Ikebukuro used to be a city where
foreign criminals and other people
took power.
[->]They were driven out by the Ashuraâˆ’kai
after the Firmament was formed...
[->]But after that, it was taken over
by a foreign demon.
[->]It just goes to show that Ikebukuro's
always been a city under the thumbs
of outside influences.

1: (Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403001]The Ring of Gaea used to make
themselves out to be some kind of
human rights organization.
[->]But they would bomb cities, and
hailed the demons when they worked...
[->]...Well, everybody knows they're
pretty much a cult now. It's best
to not get involved with them.
[END]
2: (Hunter) [7a 70][13 1, 403112]Demons have Domains everywhere, and
I can't move around freely in the
city.
[->]Defeating the demons that set up he
Domains would solve that probem, but
Xi Wangmu's behind this...
[END]
3: (Hunter) [7a 70][13 1, 403141]...Now that Xi Wangmu's dead, the
Domains seem to be gone as well.
[->]Now I can finally head to the eastern
entrance of the station and other
places in that direction.

101: (Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403001]It's true that the people in the
Ring of Gaea are kind of...
unconventional...
[->]But, they're right about one thing:
If you want to survive in Tokyo with
the demons, you need power.
[->]There's no guarantee that Tayama can
look after us until the very end,
after all.
