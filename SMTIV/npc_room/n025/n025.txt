0: (Calm woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403321]Please don't raise a fuss with the
Ashura−kai, stranger. It's us locals
who'll suffer the consequences.
[->]For weaklings like us who can't even
set foot outside, the Ashura−kai's
all we have...
[END]
1: (Calm woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403322]Th−They did say that the battlefield
was just Ichigaya and not anywhere
else, right?
[->]Then why are all these other demons
roaming around? I−Is Roppongi okay?
[->]M−My son is in the Hills building...!
Oh God... Please...!
[END]
2: (Calm woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403302]Ah... [Flynn]? Can I ask you
a... personal favor...?
[->]If you ever have find yourself in
Roppongi's underground... and you see
a boy from Ueno...
[->]Can you tell him I'll be there to pick
him up? Could you tell him that...?
[END]
3: (Calm woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403302]Ah... [Flynn]? Can I ask you
a... personal favor...?
[->]If you ever have find yourself in
Roppongi's underground... and you see

[->]Can you tell him I'm on my way to pick
him up? Could you tell him that...?
[END]
4: (Yearning man) [7a 79][13 1, 403201]Is it just me, or... do I smell sunlight
coming from you guys?
[->]It's been 25 years since that ceiling
appeared. By the time you guys were
born...
[->]Tokyo had already been covered in an
endless night. So it's kinda strange
that you'd...
[END]
5: (Yearning man) [7a 79][13 1, 403201]By the way, I met this guy who called
himself a Samurai. He said he came from
above the ceiling...
[->]If what he said is true, can you see
the real sun from there?
[END]
6: (Yearning man) [7a 79][13 1, 403201]Ah... you Samurai from up above are
so cruel...
[->]I can smell the sunlight coming off
you. That sun we lost 25 years ago...
[->]Every time you come by, you remind me
of the scenery in Tokyo.
[END]
7: (Yearning man) [7a 79][13 1, 403201]My God... the Samurai from the world
above was the champion...?
[->]Sorry... The hope you brought us only
made me greedier...
[->]Do you think you can show me the sun
we lost 25 years ago one more time?
[END]
8: (Yearning man) [7a 79][13 1, 403201]The Samurai from the world above is
the champion, huh...?
[->]I... really wanted to see the sun we lost
25 years ago... I would have given
anything... *cough*
[->]It's too bad... I don't think I'll
make it... But... that's okay...
[->]You... are my sun now...
[END]
100: (Calm woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403312]I finally got a letter of invitation
from the Ashura−kai...
[->]I know my son won't have a very good
life staying with me... I know that
I should...
[END]
105: (Yearning man) [7a 79][13 1, 403201]Ah... it's the Samurai who smells of
the sunlight.
[->]It's been 25 years... I almost gave up,
many a time. But now I've met you...
[->]Please... I'm begging you... Let me see
the sun one last time! Just once more!
[END]
200: (Calm woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403312]It's absurd to think of raising a child
in Tokyo to begin with...
[->]I know my boy will be happy in Roppongi.
He won't go hungry there...
[->]Yes... I have to do this if I want a
real future for my son...
[END]
300: (Calm woman) [7a 123][13 1, 403322]Say... The battle has been confined to
Ichigaya, right? All the other regions
are safe, aren't they?
[->]Y−You see, my son... He's in the
Hills building in Roppongi...
[->]Oh, my baby! Please forgive me! I−If
I'd only know... I'd never have let
you go...!
[END]
