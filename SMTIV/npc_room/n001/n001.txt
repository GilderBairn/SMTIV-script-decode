0: (Innocent man) [7a 34][13 1, 403202]Anyone who comes of age at 18 must
undergo the ceremony at Mikado Castle.
[->]I was born and raised here, so it was
a short trip for me. But it must be a
chore for those who live very far away.
[END]
1: (Innocent man) [7a 34][13 1, 403241]Most of the youths who were here for
the ceremony have gone back to their
hometowns.
[->]But I think I saw a few of them staying
around Mikado Castle for a few days
before the return trip.
[END]
2: (Innocent man) [7a 34][13 1, 403203]I would like to take my son to work
with me sometime soon so he can start
to learn my trade...
[->]But he spends all his time in something
called a ”Sabbath” in another village.
I rarely see him until the next morning.
[END]
3: (Innocent man) [7a 34][13 1, 403213]The Black Samurai said that people became
demons by reading Literature, right?
[->]You can't be serious... I have friends
who've been reading that stuff...
[END]
4: (Innocent man) [7a 34][13 1, 403203]I used to have a son. But he became
engrossed in Sabbaths and refused to
work.
[->]So he will be among those in the next
public execution, as he is no longer
a contributing member of society.
[->]As expiation for my failures as a
father, I'll raise this adopted son
in his place.
[END]
5: (Innocent man) [7a 34][13 1, 403203]I once had a son. He refused to work
and spend all of his time attending
Sabbaths.
[->]So I had him executed. He was no longer
a contributing member of society.
[->]As expiation for my failures as a
father, I'll raise this adopted son
in his place.
[END]
6: (Innocent man) [7a 34][13 1, 403223]I once had a son. He refused to work
and spend all of his time attending
Sabbaths.
[->]So I had him executed. I thought he
was no longer a contributing member
of society...
[->]But is this God's reward for me?
I even adopted another son to do my
part for the kingdom...
[END]
7: (Talkative woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403303]If you become a Blessed Samurai, you'll
be counted as a Luxuror too! What a
boon that must be!
[->]Though I'm satisfied being a Casualry,
myself. It's the station in life God
has given me.
[END]
8: (Talkative woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403303]Oh, what a young Blessed Samurai you are.
Are you on holiday today?
[->]Do you know the bakery in the castle
town? It's quite popular...
[->]Even Luxurors come down to buy the
bread there.
[END]
9: (Talkative woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403341]That bakery always smells so good.
[->]Just yesterday, I was telling a boy
from outside the village about it...
[END]
10: (Talkative woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403302]The baker seems to do a brisk business.
He even gets customers from other
villages.
[->]Until now, no one had ever considered
shopping outside their hometown...
[->]I suppose it's because of those
Sabbaths. I see a lot of people come
and go these days.
[END]
11: (Talkative woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403302]Black Samurai said that God bore us
no love...
[->]Does she mean that there is no God?
Then who assigned our roles?
[END]
12: (Talkative woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403302]Black Samurai said that God bore us
no love...
[->]But that was utter bilge. Of course
God exists!
[->]Why, our new leader called herself a
messenger from God, didn't she?
[END]
13: (Talkative woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403302]I've actually never met the new leader
in the flesh.
[->]But you can tell from all the wise
words that come to us from the
Monastery...
[->]She really is a messenger of God.
She knows everything happening in
this kingdom.
[END]
14: (Talkative woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403321]I've actually never met the new leader
in the flesh.
[->]There's a thought that gives me shivers.
We blindly put our trust in someone
we'd never once met.
[END]
15: (Craftsman) [7a 35][13 1, 403242]Today's that ceremony, right? That means
there'll be a whole mob of people coming
to Mikado Castle...
[->]I'd best pick up the pace on my work,
shouldn't I?
[->]Ah well. I'm not paid to use my brain.
The Luxurors can do the thinking for me.
[END]
16: (Craftsman) [7a 35][13 1, 403242]I saw a group of Blessed Samurai this
morning. Were they departing on some
mission?
[->]And if they are, should I pick up the
pace on my work?
[->]Ah well. I'm not paid to use my brain.
The Luxurors can do the thinking for me.
[END]
17: (Craftsman) [7a 35][13 1, 403242]I heard tell there was an expedition to
Kiccigiorgi. Is that right?
[->]That peaceful burg is far from any
strife. Why go there?
[->]Oh, how the question torments me...
But the Luxurors will solve it for
us, so there's no sense worrying.
[END]
18: (Craftsman) [7a 35][13 1, 403242]The Blessed Samurai are still going to
and fro even after that Black Samurai's
execution...
[->]Perhaps I should pick up the pace to
satisfy the higher demand...?
[->]Ah well. The Luxurors will tell me if
it's necessary, I suppose.
[END]
19: (Craftsman) [7a 35][13 1, 403242]I hear that the Blessed Samurai will
continue to go on more expeditions...
[->]I was asked to pick up the pace to
satisfy the higher demand.
[->]Our new leader is so resourceful! She
makes her decisions before I can even
bring her the question.
[END]
20: (Craftsman) [7a 35][13 1, 403242]The Blessed Samurai are still going
willy−nilly over the land.
[->]So I'll be picking up the pace, as our
new leader has ordered.
[->]Since we're about to usher in the new
millennium, we tradesmen of the kingdom
must join forces and work harder.
[END]
21: (Craftsman) [7a 35][13 1, 403242]The Blessed Samurai are still going
willy−nilly over the land...
[->]They've a tough road to hoe. I must pick
up the pace of my work to do my part.
[->]After all, we're emigrating to a new
land, yes? So we tradesmen of the kingdom
must join forces and work harder.
[END]
22: (Fearful woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403313]Ah... ahhhhh...!
[END]
23: (Demon) [7a 65112][13 1, 412001]This is a red pill I got in Tokyo.
The choice is yours. Eat it and join
us in demonhood...
[->]Or stay human−−a slave to God−−and end
your miserable life here. Choose now.
[END]
102: (Innocent man) [7a 34][13 1, 403203]They'll be letting us Casualries into
Mikado Castle today.
[->]The Monastery has summoned us all to
Obelisk Plaza this morning...
[->]They said it would be a holiday from
work, but I ask you, what is more
important in this world than work?
[END]
103: (Innocent man) [7a 34][13 1, 403213]My son is so engrossed in Sabbaths
that he's not willing to learn an
honest trade...
[->]So I've decided to take this boy into
my home. He's an orphan who lost his
parents in Cheoda to demons.
[->]According to what I've read, this sort
of thing is called ”adoption.”
[END]
106: (Innocent man) [7a 34][13 1, 403202]...I had a son... He spent his time at
Sabbaths instead of working. In the end,
he was executed...
[->]It was I who reported him to the
authorities. I was only doing my duty
to my kingdom...
[->]But don't worry about me, blessed
Samurai. As I was just telling someone
else who was concerned about me...
[->]My son never could sleep alone when he
was alive. I think I may join him to
bring him comfort...
[END]
110: (Talkative woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403302]I just overheard a rumor from a few
Luxurors...
[->]They said that the event at the castle
today is the Black Samurai's execution.
[->]But the Black Samurai is a friendly sort
who brought us books, isn't she? Why the
execution?
[END]
117: (Craftsman) [7a 35][13 1, 403242]These days, the Blessed Samurai are
dispatched all across the kingdom.
[->]I think that I should pick up my pace
to fulfill the expected need...
[->]But I can't be sure. I'll let the
Luxurors decide...
[END]
118: (Craftsman) [7a 35][13 1, 403242]The Blessed Samurai are needed for more
expeditions than before, I suppose...
[->]Perhaps I should pick up the pace to
satisfy the higher demand...?
[->]Ah well, it's not for me to decide.
That's the Luxurors' job.
[END]
217: (Craftsman) [7a 35][13 1, 403242]I've never seen the town this lively
outside of the Gauntlet Rite...
[->]Perhaps I should pick up the pace to
satisfy the higher demand...?
[->]But I can't be sure. I'll let the
Luxurors decide...
[END]
