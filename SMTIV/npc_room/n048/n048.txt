0: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 51][13 1, 404303]Go through the underground area in
Tokyo Station and you will find
Tsukiji, the Ring of Gaea sanctuary.
[->]However, if you lack the necessary
strength or skill, you will be denied
entry.
[END]
1: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 51][13 1, 404332]It seems you possess the power and
prowess to enter our sanctuary.
[->]The Ring of Gaea welcomes you and
your skill...
[END]
2: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 51][13 1, 404303]I hear you raised your sword against
Lady Yuriko. Normally, I wouldn't
tolerate such insolence...
[->]But, Lady Yuriko seems extremely
intrigued by your fortitude and
bravery.
[->]I will let this transgression pass...
this time. Don't get carried away.
[END]
3: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 51][13 1, 404331]Welcome, comrades!
We welcome you and your skill!
[->]Quickly! Head for Tsukiji!
Lady Yuriko is expecting you!
[END]
4: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 51][13 1, 404312]How dare you show your faces here...
You are nothing but heretics to us.
Do you understand this?
[->]If you wish to go to Tsukiji, I
won't stop you. Lady Yuriko has said
that she will deal with you herself.
[END]
5: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 51][13 1, 404341]Tayama has headed for Ichigaya.
I received word from one of our men
stationed outside.
[->]Tayama must have learned about Lady
Yuriko's plans... I can see that
he's restless now.
[->]After all, he's nothing but a
nouveauâˆ’riche punk. The best time
to defeat him is now!
[END]
