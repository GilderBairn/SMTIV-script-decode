0: (Neurisher) [7a 105][13 1, 403442]Just when I thought Kenji's rule was
over, this Akira guy comes and takes
over Ikebukuro?
[->]Well, no matter who becomes King of
Tokyo, I'll welcome him.
[->]...It doesn't change the fact that
my brains are being sucked out...

1: (Neurisher) [7a 108][13 1, 403503]Long ago, Ikebukuro was controlled
by foreign demons. It was terrible...
[->]They didn't have neurishers back
then... The demons would just eat
people whole, whenever they wanted.
[->]The old King of Tokyo, Kenji, defeated
the leader of those foreign demons.
[->]People might say a lot of other
things about him, but in a way,
Kenji was our savior.
