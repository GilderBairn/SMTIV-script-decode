0: (Male neurisher) [7a 107][13 1, 403403]It was demons who destroyed Tokyo!
H−How could I ever fuse with them!?
[->]I−I mean... How could anyone choose to
do such a horrible thing...? I'll never
understand it...
[END]
1: (Male neurisher) [7a 107][13 1, 403403]It's all Kenji's fault that Tokyo's
like this... Just because he defied
God...
[->]Huh? Archangels? Nah, can't be. Kenji
supposedly killed all the angels.
[->]But if the archangels really do exist...
Do you think they'd drive all the demons
out of Tokyo?
[END]
2: (Female demonoid) [7a 148][13 1, 419301]Hey, doesn't that thing on your arm
have a demon summoning program
installed?
[->]Where'd you get it? What...? D−Did you
say ”from a rite”?
[->]So you didn't download it? Must be
different from the one I had...
[END]
3: (Female demonoid) [7a 148][13 1, 419301]Say, Mr. Intruder... Have we met?
[->]You know, I used to be in the Counter−
Demon Force. Back when I was a human,
that is.
[->]So, if you have the demon summoning
program, that means you were in the
force too, right?
[END]
4: (Female demonoid) [7a 148][13 1, 419305]Kenji was originally from the Counter−
Demon Force. He was about your age at
the time...
[->]He joined the force to fight demons
and protect Tokyo...
[->]But then he learned that the reason
demons showed up in the first place
was part of God's scheme...
[->]After that, he sided with the demons
to stop God's wrath.
[->]That was 25 years ago...
[END]
5: (Female demonoid) [7a 148][13 1, 419307]Come to think of it, maybe the real
reason Kenji turned the people of Tokyo
into demonoids and neurishers...
[->]Was because he was afraid of the
Intruders. I don't know how that
works, really, but...
[->]It seems the demon summoning program
can only be activated by someone with
a strong will.
[->]Kenji's thrashed enough demons in his
day to know how strong a man's will
can be...
[END]

[END]
7: (Female neurisher) [7a 110][13 1, 403503]Being a neurisher isn't so bad. We don't
need to fight, for starters...
[->]And the demonoids can't kill us,
or else they'll starve to death.
[END]
8: (Female neurisher) [7a 110][13 1, 403503]Staying in Kasumigaseki makes me feel
like those days in Ichigaya were just
a bad dream...
[->]These days, Kenji doesn't get many
challengers. But he had to fend off
all kinds of people back then.
[->]Ichigaya was practically a war zone.
I knew so many people who got killed
in the crossfire...
[->]You know, the neurishers in all of
Tokyo's regions now are the ones who
fled Ichigaya.
[END]
9: (Male demonoid) [7a 103][13 1, 415109]Who was the asshole screaming his head
off in the briefing room!?
[->]Keep quiet or you'll bring Akira down
on you!
[END]
10: (Male demonoid) [7a 103][13 1, 415105]Hey, how'd you get in here, anyway?
Isn't there a guard in front of the
elevator?
[->]And you just show up from the briefing
room... Just what kind of magic show
are you running?
[END]
11: (Jonathan) [7a 3][13 1, 400102]These ”Intruders”... I take it he
refers to us.
[->]It seems we've landed ourselves in a
much more precarious position than we
had thought.
[->]Perhaps it would be wise to align
ourselves with Akira...
[END]
12: (Male demonoid) [7a 103][13 1, 415102]I hear Kenji used to have a partner.
A buddy from his Counter−Demon Force
days...
[->]That dude saved me when I was a human.
[->]Your ponytailed dude kinda reminds me
of him, as far as the looks and
attitude goes...
[->]But I heard that dude died in action
against demons while he was covering
for Kenji.
[END]
13: (Male demonoid) [7a 103][13 1, 415102]I hear Kenji used to have a partner.
A buddy from his Counter−Demon Force
days...
[->]But I also heard he got killed in
action while covering for Kenji.
[->]That taught Kenji that even with a team
of strong demons backing you up, the
human body is too weak...
[->]It was after that when Kenji decided
to become a demonoid, or so I hear...
[END]

[END]
101: (Male neurisher) [7a 107][13 1, 403403]I told Akira I'd stay in Kasumigaseki.
[->]I'm tired of the demonoids marching me
around... Besides which, my legs are
too weak to walk anymore.
[->]Anyway, I never liked Shinjuku, even
when I was just a human. Too crowded,
you know?
[END]
201: (Male neurisher) [7a 107][13 1, 403403]King Akira promised us he'd rebuild
Tokyo into someplace everyone could
live in peace and equality...
[->]A pretty heroic guy, ain't he? For a
demonoid and all.
[->]Then I'll become the ultimate neurisher.
A superior neurisher to tantalize the
taste buds of gourmet demonoids...
[END]
301: (Male neurisher) [7a 107][13 1, 403403]King Akira promised us he'd rebuild
Tokyo into someplace everyone could
live in peace and equality...
[->]I'm just wondering how he plans to deal
with the demonoids eating neurishers.
[->]His promise raises some serious
questions... But I still believe
he can do it.
[END]
