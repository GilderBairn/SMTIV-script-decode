0: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]Hey, you've seen a girl, right? She
looks teenaged, wears a school
uniform...
[->]I remember... When I was sealed inside
Tokyo, I was her age...
[END]
1: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]It's just like 25 years ago... demons
came to Tokyo and slaughtered so many
people...
[->]If history is about to repeat itself,
I wish the ceiling wasn't there so
we could accept God's wrath...
[END]
2: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]Someone created that ceiling...
[->]And then a champion arrived...
[->]But I'm the same as I was 25 years ago.
I haven't grown up. I still just cling
to the hope that someone will save me...
[END]
3: (Strong−eyed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]Is it true that angel was defeated!?
The one who sealed us in Tokyo...!?
[->]Then if we get rid of the demons,
can we finally be free...?
[END]
4: (Strong−eyed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]These folks traveled a long way to
find hope in Tokyo, right?
[->]We've gotta do our best not to
disappoint them.
[END]
5: (Middle−aged woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403331]The girl next to me seems a little too
excited.
[->]There's no need to get hysterical.
Whatever happens, happens, right?
[END]
6: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403221]The Ashura−kai sure are violent. But hey,
you won't hear me complaining.
[->]Everyone knows we're still alive today
thanks to their stockpiles of stuff.
[->]Plus, the electricity they generate
let us live in safety in these
underground districts...
[END]
7: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403221]Hey, have you seen that guy from the
Eastern Kingdom of Mikado?
[->]He said that the people there worship
God. If you see him again, can you
give him a message from me?
[->]”There are demons in Tokyo. Ask God
to do something about it.”
(Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403241]I hear the tournament to crown the
champion is heating up.
[->]Everyone's fighting demons... I guess
I should try and pitch in to make the
world a better place, too...
[END]
9: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403202]Did you guys see a man from the Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado there?
[->]I hear the people there worship God...
But I'd rather worship a champion over
something I can't actually see.
[->]”Champion”... Just the sound of it
is inspiring...
[END]
10: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403232]I saw a lot of unfamiliar faces in the
underground district today...
[->]When I talked to them, they said they
were from the Eastern Kingdom of
Mikado...
[->]They were marching to Kabuki−cho with
this white−haired, dignified man as
their leader...
[END]
12: (Hunter) [7a 118][13 1, 403002]I don't WANT to eat demon meat,
of course...
[->]But we've eaten all the wild birds in
the area already. We've got nothing
else left...
[END]
13: (Hunter) [7a 118][13 1, 403012]Those Jirae were living inside the
Metropolitan Government Office before
we were...
[->]I didn't want to see them kicked out
if it could be avoided... I wish there
was a peaceful way to solve it.
[END]
14: (Hunter) [7a 118][13 1, 403042]Those Jirae were living inside the
Metropolitan Government Office before
we were...
[->]I'm glad we didn't hurt them, but I
still feel bad about kicking them out.
[END]
15: (Hunter man) [7a 118][13 1, 403002]We used to joke about hunting demons
to shore up our food supply...
[->]Now look us. We're the prey...
[END]
16: (Hunter man) [7a 118][13 1, 403002]Demon meat is an important source of
food for us. We have to hunt them if
we want to survive...
[->]I'll go back to my regular job. I doubt
I'll ever be the champion, but I can
still work...
[END]
17: (Hunter man) [7a 118][13 1, 403001]The demons out there are strong, but
we've got you on our side now. I don't
see how we can lose!
[->]Let's hunt down all the demons!
[END]
18: (Hunter man) [7a 118][13 1, 403001]There are some demons left outside.
But we've got you guys! I don't see
how we can lose.
[->]Let's hunt down all the demons!
[END]
19: (Craftsman) [7a 25][13 1, 403041]These Tokyo folk are wonderful! They
fight demons without so much as any
Samurai training!
[->]Perhaps I should forge weapons for
these ”Hunters.”
[END]
20: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404301]Yo, hey! Move out the way! Don't ya
know who I am!? I'm from the Ashura−kai!
[->]Ya step to me, ya step to Mr. Tayama!
Got that!?
[END]
21: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404301]Good work on that cleanup job at the
Metropolitan Government Office. Not
bad at all, kid.
[->]I told Mr. Tayama all about it.
You oughtta thank me.
[END]
22: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404301]I heard what ya did at the Metropolitan
Governnment Office. It's no big deal,
since we got 'em outta there...
[->]I'll be passing word about it on to
Mr. Tayama. Ya oughtta thank me.
[END]
23: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404321]I saw a huge pillar of light shoot up
through the Ichigaya area...
[->]Now, I keep myself alive with demons
runnin' around, y'know? So I don't
consider myself a coward or nothin'.
[->]But when I saw that pillar of light...
For a second, I got so scared that I
thought I was gonna die...
[END]
24: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404321]Those selfish bastards at the
Association! Well, Fujiwara was
their padrone, so whaddaya expect...
[->]They found out about Mr. Tayama.
Fujiwara set it up...
[->]Looks like that wraps it up for the
Ashura−kai's reign.
[END]
25: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404321]Man, these days, everyone's all about
this ”Champion.” No one gives a rip
anymore that we're with the Ashura−kai.
[->]Though even if we did use every trick in
the book to hide it, we've basically been
swindling them for 25 years...
[->]That shriveled−up conscience of mine
has started feelin' guilty after all
these years...
[END]
26: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404321]Who were those guys that came down from
above the ceiling? Samurai, huh?
[->]Bad enough we got Hunters doggin' us.
Plus those stone−headed guys in the
city...
[->]I tell ya, the Ashura−kai got no place
in Tokyo anymore. Guess I oughtta start
hittin' the bricks for a new job.
[END]
100: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]I actually live in Atsugi... I was in
Shinjuku for some shopping that day.
[->]My friend is gone now... I'm alone...
[END]
106: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403241]I was chatting with a dude who said he
was from someplace called the Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado...
[->]According to him, this ”Mikado” place
doesn't even have electricity!
[->]I don't know where that is in Tokyo,
but it sure sounds like a rough life
over there...
[END]
114: (Hunter man) [7a 118][13 1, 403042]Not used
[END]
122: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404311]I heard what ya did in Ikebukuro.
Been busy lately, huh?
[->]Well, ya'd better keep your nose clean
in Shinjuku. And stay outta Shinjuku
National Park, ya hear?
[END]
200: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]Huh? There's a Sanctuary in Shinjuku?
[->]Well... there's a place called Harajuku
there. That's kind of a sanctuary for
teenagers craving radical new fashions.
[->]Oh? That's not the kind of sanctuary
you meant?
[END]
206: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403241]I was chatting with a dude who said he
was from someplace called the Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado...
[->]I was only half listening to him, but
the place sounds like a fertile land
with lots of greenery.
[->]If what he told me is true, I'd love
to visit this Eastern Kingdom of
Mikado someday...
[END]
222: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404311]Don't underestimate the stuff we know,
kid. You've been busy, haven't ya?
[->]Eh, Samurai boy?
[->]Well, I'm sure we'll hear more from
you in Shibuya. Just don't piss off
Mr. Tayama, ya get me?
[END]
300: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]Once I had a Hunter I met in Shinjuku
take me to Shibuya.
[->]It was fun... we had a few laughs,
a few drinks... For a little while,
I forgot all about the ceiling...
[->]But I guess I can't be that naive
anymore...
[END]
306: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403241]Hey, I haven't seen that guy from the
Eastern Kingdom of Mikado...
[->]He told me that religion is a pretty
big thing there. I don't believe in
God, myself...
[->]But war is about to break out inside
Tokyo. If there is a God, I wish he'd
save us all.
[END]
322: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404311]Don't underestimate the stuff we know,
kid. You've been busy, haven't ya?
[->]Eh, Samurai boy?
[->]You better kiss up to Mr. Tayama,
ya hear me? It's the smartest move
ya can make in this city.
[END]
400: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]I'm originally from Atsugi. I was
shopping in Shinjuku when that ceiling
appeared...
[->]I had a friend who stayed with me.
We talked a lot about how much we
wanted to go to Roppongi...
[->]But then... that friend of mine ate
one of the red pills...
[END]
422: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404311]What's wrong, Samurai kid? Aren't ya
in the middle of a job Mr. Tayama
gave ya?
[->]Don't ya frickin' tell me you're on
your break right now.
[->]Speakin' of which... There's a good
coffee shop in Kabuki−cho where I
like to go for a break...
[END]
500: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]By the way, a little while before the
ceiling appeared, these strange−looking
people tried to talk to me.
[->]They were with some kind of religion.
They wanted to take me to Tsukiji
Hongwanji...
[END]
522: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404311]Those Ring of Gaea guys who worship
Yuriko are basically power freaks.
[->]Former pro fighters, company execs,
that kind. People who like to show off
their power.
[->]But they never think to use their power
to help other folks. It just don't
occur to 'em.
[END]
600: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]You know, not long after the ceiling
appeared, there were these guys from
the Ashura−kai...
[->]They asked me if I had any children...
I'm not even married!
[END]
622: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404311]Yuriko's one daredevil of a babe...
Ya know Mr. Tayama's got a Samurai
locked up, yeah?
[->]She sent a direct message to him through
that... what are those things called?
Gauntlets?
[->]She said, ”I'm coming for your Yamato
Reactor...” They're plannin' to steal
our generator!
[END]
700: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]The Yakuza and those cultists are about
to go to war, huh?
[->]Please... get me out of here! I don't
want to stay in Tokyo anymore! I'm
begging you, get me out of Tokyo...!
[END]
1422: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404311]Rumor has it the guys at Florida have
gone up above the ceiling.
[->]I hear they used demons to dig through
the Sky Tower's ceiling.
[->]They even brought in a Terminal they
found somewhere.
[->]I guess one of them, the guy in charge
used to be a military dude.
[END]
