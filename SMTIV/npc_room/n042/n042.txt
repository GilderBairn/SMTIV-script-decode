was filled with young guys.

with demons who want Reds...
[->]Though since that demon moved in,
things have quieted down...

1: (Youthful man) [7a 81][13 1, 403402]Just as I suspected, the reason Yuriko's
interested in Ichigaya isn't the
electricity...
[->]The reactor there emits an electro−
magnetic pulse in a frequency that
attracts demons.
[->]So that B−grade occult magazine article
was right! The Ring of Gaea really is
an evil cult!
[END]
2: (Youthful man) [7a 81][13 1, 403431]I hear there's a Samurai who's making
a serious play for the champion title.
[->]That's an admirable effort in this
demon−wrecked world, don't you think?

[->]Where there are demons, soon there'll
be angels, and next thing you know,
full−scale war will break out in Tokyo.

was right! The Ring of Gaea really is
a doomsday cult!
[END]
4: (Youthful man) [7a 81][13 1, 403403]There's a rumor that demons are pouring
out from a reactor in Ichigaya...
[->]We need electricity, so the reactor
is a must−have.
[->]In a way, Tokyo never was completely
free from the threat of demons...

5: (Moody man) [7a 81][13 1, 403212]There were once office complexes where
the Hills building and Midtown stand...
[->]The Hills in Roppongi is the Ashura−kai
headquarters now.
[->]And I hear Midtown is a nest of demons...

6: (Moody man) [7a 81][13 1, 403212]Someone told me that the angels are
coming down from above the ceiling...
is that true?
[->]I bet they're planning to kill us all
along with the demons...!
[END]
7: (Moody man) [7a 81][13 1, 403241]I hear a Samurai named [Flynn]
is a hair's breadth from the champion's
title.
[->]It's good to know there's one man who
stands above the rest in this awful
world...
[END]
8: (Moody man) [7a 81][13 1, 403241]Hey, champion! You can stop them,
right!?
[->]If those angels really are coming down
to Tokyo, you can stop them, can't you!?
[END]
9: (Moody man) [7a 81][13 1, 403213]You really stopped the angels! You're
the best, champion!
[->]B−But... Tokyo's still full of demons...
[->]You can stop them for us too, right,
champion?
[END]
10: (Moody man) [7a 81][13 1, 403213]You stopped both the angels and the
demons! You're the best, champion!
[->]B−But... Tokyo still has no sunrise...
[->]You can do something about that for us
too, right, champion?

[->]And since that one demon isn't here
now, I expect that others will start
coming back...

actually a−−

It's just a rumor, you know?
