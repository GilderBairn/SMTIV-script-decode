0: (Calm Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403042]This kingdom was founded by God. But so
then why have demons come here?
[->]The question tormented me... But now
that the demons are driven out, I think
I understand the answer...
[->]Perhaps God granted us a chance to
prove ourselves by trial, believing
that we would prevail in the end.
[->]What a stern love and trust... Only our
Father could have brought them to us...
[END]
1: (Calm Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403042]On the Commander's orders, we've alerted
the nearby villages to the situation and
brought their people to the castle.
[->]Still... abandoning the Eastern Kingdom
of Mikado and setting out for a new
land...
[->]Do you think they will take to such
an idea...?
[END]
2: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403002]I have never met the new leaders
in person...
[->]But the fact that all the demons have
disappeared from the kingdom is proof
enough of their presence...
[END]
3: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403002]Isabeau was urging us not to rely on
the new leaders.
[->]Though they have shown us miracles upon
miracles, they remain silent when a
crisis befalls us...
[->]In the end, we must choose our own
course... I think I understand what
Isabeau was getting at.
[END]
4: (Forceful Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403041]I had a dream... And in this dream,
I saw our new leaders unite as one...
[->]”Why did you become one?” I asked.
And in response...
[->]”It's what our Lord wished,” they said.
[END]
5: (Forceful Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403041]I saw it in my dream... Our new leaders
gradually disappearing...
[->]”Why are you leaving us?” I asked.
And in response...
[->]”The people of this kingdom no longer
need us,” they said.
[END]
6: (Hope) [7a 8][13 1, 400604][Flynn]... No, that is too
familiar. 'Tis more proper to call you
the warrior of light now.
[->]Demon sightings have been greatly
diminished of late. We will soon stop
sending Samurai across the kingdom.
[->]True peace will at last prevail in our
Eastern Kingdom of Mikado...
[->]Perhaps I may even live to see the
Samurai disbanded...
[END]
7: (Hope) [7a 8][13 1, 400603][Flynn]...
[->]I saw you emerge from Naraku alongside
a flaxen−haired girl.
[->]It was not long after that the horde
of demons surged into our kingdom...
[->]I fear no demon. What I fear, rather,
is the terrible thought growing in my
mind...
[->]Have I... forged the worst threat to
this kingdom with my own hands...?
[END]
8: (Hope) [7a 8][13 1, 400601][Flynn]... Yes, I've heard it all
from Isabeau...
[->]About God's chariot, and what became
of Jonathan...
[->][Flynn]... This is merely my own
opinion, but growing up means choosing
one's friends.
[->]As your life grows busier, your time to
spend with friends lessens. So you cling
to those you feel comfortable with...
[->]Rather than spend your precious idle
moments with those who do not share
your views.
[->]I may be doing a poor job of explaining
myself... I just wanted to say that you
needn't feel disappointed in yourself.
[END]
113: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403002]Abbot Hugo convened an emergency meeting
for the people gathered in Mikado Castle.
[->]We are to abandon the Eastern Kingdom
of Mikado and emigrate to Tokyo as our
new home...
[->]The abbot's final words brought tears
to my eyes...
[->]We abandon this land not out of despair,
but out of hope. The hope for us all to
finally come into our own...
[END]
