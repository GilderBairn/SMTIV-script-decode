0: (Akira) [7a 84][13 1, 401605]I have found a life of chaos in the
world created through God's order.
[->]I doubt God ever accounted for that
happening. I feel like whooping for
joy...!
[->]I won't be silent anymore. First,
let me thank you.
[->]You... and Kiyoharu, who summoned you
all here...
[END]
1: (Akira) [7a 84][13 1, 401601]By the way, you released the people in
Shibuya, right?
[->]Can't say I approve of your unauthorized
use of a Terminal, but...
[->]You made everyone's dreams come true.
From the bottom of my heart, thank you
for that.
[END]
2: (Hermit man) [7a 97][13 1, 403212]What's going on?  I know Kiyoharu's
always in a good mood...
[->]But today he was screaming with
happiness before running upstairs...
[END]
3: (Hermit man) [7a 97][13 1, 403212]I've seen many brave souls enter Pluto
Castle... Some of them were former
Counter−Demon Force troops...
[->]But the only one who's ever returned
from the castle was the one who got us
intel on Pluto. That's it.
[->]Pluto is far too strong for us...!
[END]
4: (Hermit man) [7a 97][13 1, 403203]I've seen many brave souls enter Pluto
Castle... Some of them were former
Counter−Demon Force troops...
[->]Now that Pluto is dead, those lost souls
can finally be at rest...
[END]
5: (Sharp−looking man) [7a 162][13 1, 404321]Hm? You there! The one with the
ponytail! C−Could you be...?
[->]No... couldn't be. Sorry, I had the
wrong man.
[END]
6: (Sharp−looking man) [7a 162][13 1, 404313]Hm? You there! The one with the
ponytail! C−Could you be...?
[->]No... couldn't be. Sorry, I had the
wrong man.
[->]When Kiyoharu was in the Counter−Demon
Force, there was a kid who used to hang
around with him. He looked like you...
[->]Hm? The kid? Oh... Pluto's poison got
him in the end...
[END]
7: (Sharp−looking man) [7a 162][13 1, 404321]Was it coincidence or fate that you
guys became our Messiahs...?
[->]Either way, one thing's certain...
Kiyoharu never gave up hope.
[->]Even when he was betrayed by God or
infected with the poison... He just
refused to give up.
[END]
8: (Hermit woman) [7a 98][13 1, 403321]Hey! I told you to keep your goggles
on tight!
[END]
9: (Hermit child) [7a 95][13 1, 404012]But it hurts... Can I take them
off, mom?
[END]
10: (Hermit woman) [7a 98][13 1, 403302]What do I always tell you? You'll get
sick from the Tormentor's poison if
you do that.
[END]
11: (Hermit child) [7a 98]Okay... I don't wanna get sick.
[END]
12: (Hermit woman) [7a 98][13 1, 403312]Kiyoharu was once a student who went
to a famous private high school.
[->]But then the demons came to Tokyo,
and everything about our life changed...
[END]
13: (Hermit child) [7a 98]I'm sorry I can't show you Tokyo like
it used to be.
[END]
14: (Hermit woman) [7a 98]I still can't believe it... a war
between angels and demons...
[->]If only we could have escaped from this
hell on those angels' ark...
[END]
15: (Hermit child) [7a 98]Yeah. It's because we weren't God's
chosen ones.
 
[END]
16: (Stiff woman) [7a 163][13 1, 403312]D−Did you say you came from outside!?
Are you insane!?
[->]The air outside is choked with poison!
How can you walk around in that getup!?
[END]
17: 〉 The woman is staring at you with obvious
fear in her wide eyes...
[END]
18: (Stiff woman) [7a 163][13 1, 403312]I was once a doctor, you know, and I
can tell you this for sure: once you're
infected with Pluto's poison, that's it.
[->]We've tried amputating to isolate the
poison... We autopsied everyone who
fell victim, but it was no help at all.
[->]Akira's confirmed it. Once the poison
is in your system, your days are
numbered...
[END]
19: (Tough woman) [7a 98][13 1, 403333]You guys beat Pluto, right? Then why
not help out our association too?
[->]I know Tokyo's a mess, but it's where
we've got to live.
[END]
20: (Hunter man) [7a 99][13 1, 403012]Now that Pluto is gone, his poison will
also fade in time.
[->]For now, it's safe to say that we've
retaken Tokyo for the sake of the
generations to come...
[END]
21: (Hunter man) [7a 99][13 1, 403012]Now that Pluto is gone, his poison will
also fade in time.
[->]For now, it's safe to say that we've
retaken Tokyo for the sake of the
generations to come...
[->]Even if I fall in battle, my child,
or my grandchild, could see my dreams
through...
[END]
100: (Akira) [7a 84][13 1, 401601]...Oh, it's you.
[->]I'm holding meetings to finalize our
vision of an ideal Tokyo to be restored.
[->]We have to get everyone's input and
compile it to come up with an ideal
goal. It'll take time...
[->]It makes me want to know what he thinks
about this, but I wouldn't want to take
up any of his precious time.
[->]It's my responsibility to give the
people hope. And that's what I'll do...
No matter how long it takes...
[END]
104: (Hermit man) [7a 97][13 1, 403203]I've seen many brave souls enter Pluto
Castle... Some of them were former
Counter−Demon Force troops...
[->]Now that Pluto is dead, those lost souls
can finally be at rest...
[->]Once Tokyo is restored enough that it's
safe to go outside again, I'll dig
graves for them...
[END]
107: (Sharp−looking man) [7a 162][13 1, 404321]Was it coincidence or fate that you
guys became our Messiahs...?
[->]Either way, one thing's certain...
Kiyoharu never gave up hope.
[->]Even when he was betrayed by God or
infected with the poison... He just
refused to give up.
[END]
204: (Hermit man) [7a 97][13 1, 403203]I've seen many brave souls enter Pluto
Castle... Some of them were former
Counter−Demon Force troops...
[->]I wish they were still here, helping
us build a new country... If anyone
deserves that, it's them.
[->]Once Tokyo is restored enough that it's
safe to go outside again, I'll dig
graves for them...
[END]
207: (Sharp−looking man) [7a 162][13 1, 404341]You there... The one with the ponytail.
You remind me of a boy who died long
ago...
[->]When Kiyoharu was in the Counter−Demon
Force, there was a kid who used to hang
around with him. He looked like you...
[->]Funny coincidence that the Messiah who
arrived to answer Kiyoharu's prayers
looked like HIM!
