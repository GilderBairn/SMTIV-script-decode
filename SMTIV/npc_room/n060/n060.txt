0: (Hunter man) [7a 69][13 1, 403002]I found this city by accident while
I was searching around places the
Ashura−kai had sealed.
[->]But, man, this place is bizarre.
No wonder it's been closed off from
the outside world for a while...
[END]
1: (Hunter man) [7a 69][13 1, 403002]From what I've heard, the people here
seem to have survived by eating beef
that they raise here.
[->]But... have you seen any actual cows?
[END]
2: (Hunter man) [7a 69][13 1, 403002]We've decided to hunt demons for the
people here.
[->]If we left now, I'd feel like I was
abandoning them.
[END]
3: (Hunter man) [7a 118][13 1, 403042]It seems that the people here haven't
been eating demon meat at all.
[->]I'm surprised that they've managed
to survive this long with that kind
of diet...
[END]
4: (Hunter man) [7a 118][13 1, 403042]Beef is an extremely expensive
delicacy. In fact, it's more like
a fantasy now.
[->]Seriously it's a luxury that even the
Ashura−kai would go mad for.
[END]
5: (Hunter man) [7a 118][13 1, 403042]I feel bad for these guys, cut off
from the outside world and taken
advantage of by demons.
[->]I hope they learn to like demon meat,
after all that time they spent with
their... beef.
[END]
