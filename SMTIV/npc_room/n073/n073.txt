0: (Demonoid woman) [7a 147][13 1, 418004]I saw Akira on his way to Ichigaya.
He looks so trustworthy now.
[->]I feel that responsibility can change
a man. Right now... Akira's got all
of Tokyo on his shoulders.

1: (Demonoid man) [7a 146][13 1, 415205]The guys who came from Kasumigaseki
killed a number of people here.
[->]I mean, they were saying things like
”We'll never bow to someone like
Akira,” and all, but still...
[->]Those guys might be Akira's old
friends, but isn't this going too
far? They're acting like fanatics.
[END]
2: (Demonoid man) [7a 145][13 1, 415101]What was King Akira talking about?
”Equality” or something?
[->]I remember... That word used to mean
a lot to me when I was human...
[->]...But I've been a demonoid for so
long that I can't really bring myself
to care.
