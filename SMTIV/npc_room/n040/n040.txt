0: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 47][13 1, 403221]Aha! Here come those Samurai! I've been
waiting for you guys.
[->]I got my man waiting for you out by
Club Milton.
[->]Our orders on this came down straight
from Mr. Tayama. Let's see whether or
not you kids got any guts.
[END]
1: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 47][13 1, 403231]Hey, Samurai. Mr. Tayama's expecting you
at the Hills building.
[->]Oh, it ain't too far from Shibuya. Just
head east and you'll see a skyscraper
there.
[END]
2: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 47][13 1, 403221]Until now, the Reds were the only thing
keeping Shibuya propped up.
[->]But it's like a supermarket after a big
natural disaster... All the demons are
gonna come here, desperate for Reds.
[->]Needless to say, Shibuya's finished!
M−Maybe we should flush all the Reds...?
[END]
3: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 47][13 1, 403221]Until now, the Reds were the only thing
keeping Shibuya propped up.
[->]But now, Tokyo can say they've got the
champ backing 'em up.
[->]Soon, Tokyo won't need the Reds anymore...
[END]
4: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 47][13 1, 403203]Fujiwara sent a message to all the
Ashura−kai troops...
[->]He told 'em to keep the Ashura−kai shops
in each region open for business.
[->]It's like a supermarket after a natural
disaster. We gotta stop people from
panicking and fighting over supplies.
[->]No wonder Mr. Tayama kept his hands off
the dude... He's some kind of big−time
player.
[END]
5: (Careful man) [7a 60][13 1, 403602]That Ashura−kai guy who was here is
gone now.
[->]He mentioned something about Ichigaya...
Must be some kinda trouble.
[END]
6: (Careful man) [7a 60][13 1, 403602]That Ashura−kai dude who was here went
away in a hurry.
[->]He mentioned something about being
stationed in Ichigaya or beefing up the
defenses or something...
[->]Is there some kinda trouble?
[END]
101: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 47][13 1, 403231]Hey, Samurai... I heard you're taking
the entrance test for the Ring of Gaea.
[->]Then you oughtta head for Kasumigaseki
first and go down into Tokyo Station.
[->]Go through the underground district
and you'll find Tsukiji Hongwanji,
first thing.
[END]
102: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 47][13 1, 403221]It's like a supermarket after a big
natural disaster... All the demons are
gonna come here, desperate for Reds.
[->]Needless to say, Shibuya's finished!
It's terrifying to think about...
[->]The only thing that makes me feel better
is looking at the tourney rankings.
[END]
201: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 47][13 1, 403231]Yo, Samurai. I heard you passed the
entrance test for the Ring of Gaea...
[->]You ain't thinking about actually joining
up with those wackos and betraying us,
are you?
[->]Your one job is to off Yuriko... Don't
you forget it.
[END]
301: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 47][13 1, 403231]It seems Yuriko's been up to shenanigans
lately, so we've decided to beef up
security ”out there.”
[->]I'm headed there today myself, so I won't
see you for a while.
[->]But don't go forgetting your mission
to whack Yuriko...
[END]
