0: (Emotional man) [7a 60][13 1, 403021]I... I did it! I just kicked an
Ashura−kai goon!
[->]I−I've got no regrets! We just saved
Ikebukuro!
[END]
1: (Emotional man) [7a 60][13 1, 403002]Hey! W−We're surrounded by demons now!
Wh−What the hell's the Ashura−kai doing!?
[->]You've gotta save us! I'll do anything!
I'll lick your boots, if that's what
you want!
[END]
2: (Emotional man) [7a 60][13 1, 403041]Hunters are fighting fiercely thesedays...
Is this the effect of the overall ranking?
[->]M−Maybe... We just might defeat demons...
[END]
3: (Emotional man) [7a 60][13 1, 403002]Hey! Th−There's demons everywhere now!
And not just that, but the angels are
coming too!
[->]Y−You're the champion, right!? Help us!
I−I'll even lick your boots clean if
you do!
[END]
4: (Emotional man) [7a 60][13 1, 403002]I−I hear there are some strange folks
in the Shinjuku area...
[->]Now that the demons are gone... Maybe I
should go see what's up there...
[END]
5: (Bookworm) [7a 59][13 1, 403221]...That's not what I heard! They said
once the Ashura−kai was kicked out,
they'd release it!
[->]I can't get to the east entrance station
because of that demon's Domain! How am I
supposed to go to Juraku Books!?
[->]I really shouldn't have trusted that
foreign demon...
[END]
6: (Bookworm) [7a 59][13 1, 403212]I−I'm sure it's all fine. Even if there
are more demons, we have the Ring of
Gaea, don't we?
[->]We've joined forces to oust the
Ashura−kai before... I'm sure they'll
help us in our time of crisis!
[END]
7: (Bookworm) [7a 59][13 1, 403242]I hear the Hunter tournament is getting
pretty heated!
[->]Hmm... I guess this is no time to
keep my nose in a book... I'd better
check it out!
[END]
8: (Bookworm) [7a 59][13 1, 403203]Relying on the Ring of Gaea in Ginza
never changed anything, after all...
[->]But after seeing how hard the champion
works, I feel something inside of me
has changed.
[->]Of course, the future is still very
uncertain. But at least we have hope...
[END]
9: (Bookworm) [7a 59][13 1, 403232]The demons are no more. I guess our
excuse to waste time underground has
gone with them, eh?
[->]Then perhaps I should get a job at
Juraku Books again. Books would help the
people working on rebuilding to relax...
[->]Yes... I think that will be my role in
the new Tokyo...
[END]
10: (Nosy Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 404303]Even the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado is
becoming infested with demons...
[->]'Tis better to devote oneself to
finding mystic relics in Tokyo, no?
[->]Particularly in light of the side
benefits...
[END]
16: (Hunter woman) [7a 70][13 1, 403122]Everyone's pissed at the Ashura−kai, and
I kinda get why. It's like it used to be
with normal businesses, y'know?
[->]Your employer took care of you
financially. Well, the Ashura−kai
takes care of us too.
[->]...But since the Association is gone
now, I'm getting out of here soon too.
[END]
17: (Hunter woman) [7a 70][13 1, 403103]Fujiwara told me that even with the
demons gone, the Association will stay
in business.
[->]He said they'll need Hunters like us
for the reconstruction of Tokyo.
[->]Maybe he was anticipating this situation
would come about someday... and that's
why he formed the Association.
[END]
100: (Emotional man) [7a 60][13 1, 403021]Xi Wangmu is gone... the Ring of Gaea
isn't coming anymore...
[->]So who's going to be in charge of
Ikebukuro? Who's going to protect
us from the demons...?
[->]I−It's gotta be the Ashura−kai, right!?
They are coming back here, right!?
[END]
101: (Emotional man) [7a 60][13 1, 403002]Hey! Th−There's demons everywhere now!
Somebody! Help us! Please, I'll do
anything!
[->]I don't give a damn if you're with the
Ashura−kai or what! I'd even lick your
boots clean if you help me!
[END]
103: (Emotional man) [7a 60][13 1, 403002]Hey! Th−There's demons everywhere now!
And not just that, but something called
the Demon Lord is coming too!
[->]Y−You're the champion, right!? Help us!
I−I'll even lick your boots clean if
you do!
[END]
105: (Bookworm) [7a 59][13 1, 403241]The strange wall blocking the east
station entrance has suddenly
disappeared.
[->]Are you a Hunter? This must be nice
timing for you.
[->]Now you can go through the northeast
exit to reach Juraku Books and do
some reading!
[END]
110: (Nosy Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 404342]Abbot Hugo has sent a message to all
Samurai in Tokyo.
[->]It seems to be a matter of the utmost
importance... Eh? Shene Duque?
[->]I've received no messages regarding
that village...
[END]
116: (Hunter woman) [7a 70][13 1, 403103]...Hey, it's you. You're the one who
killed Xi Wangmu, right?
[->]Everyone's talking about you. Even in
Ueno and Shinjuku. A young, highly
talented Hunter...
[->]But what brought you to Ikebukuro?
The Association is gone now. I was
just on my way out too.
[END]
200: (Emotional man) [7a 60][13 1, 403021]What the hell is the Ashura−kai doing
now!? The reconstruction of Ikebukuro
is going nowhere!
[->]At this rate, who's going to be in
charge of Ikebukuro? Who's going to
protect us from the demons...!?
[END]
205: (Bookworm) [7a 59][13 1, 403242]You know, I saw a woman in a black suit
get taken away from Juraku Books...
[->]Wait... You guys were with her at the
time, weren't you?
[->]Just what did she do...? 
[END]
300: (Emotional man) [7a 60][13 1, 403021]What the hell is the Ashura−kai doing
now!? The reconstruction of Ikebukuro
is going nowhere!
[->]I can't take this anymore...! If no
one else will step up and make it
happen, I'll take over myself!
[->]And if anyone's got a problem with
that, they can say it to my fist!
[END]
305: (Bookworm) [7a 59][13 1, 403242]According to rumor, the Ring of Gaea's
Yuriko went in and out of Ikebukuro
alone many times.
[->]For the leader of a huge organization
like that to visit this demon−infested
region... without any bodyguards...
[->]Yuriko must be very confident in her
power, and have very trusting minions
to let her travel on her own...
[END]
400: (Emotional man) [7a 60][13 1, 403031]I did it... I did it again...!
I kicked an Ashura−kai goon!
[->]I−I've got no regrets! We'll rebuild
Ikebukuro our own damn selves!
[END]
