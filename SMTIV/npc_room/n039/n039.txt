0: (Weary man) [7a 63][13 1, 403841]In order to get the demons all over
Tokyo in one place, Tayama decided to
revamp Shibuya...
[->]He used the Reds to lure all the demons
into one place.
[->]He claims it was done to contain the
damage to Tokyo. But what about the
damage to us Shibuya locals?
[->]We got caught up in the redevelopment
scheme to make this region an easier
place to deal Reds...
[END]
1: (Weary man) [7a 63][13 1, 403841]Tayama, Yuriko, I don't care who does it,
just do something about those demons!
[->]If they really want the Reds, let's just
give 'em all we got!
[->]Please... Please get these demons away
from me...!
[END]
2: (Weary man) [7a 63][13 1, 403841]I don't care who, but someone has to do
something about these demons!
[->]If they really want the Reds, let's just
give 'em all we got!
[->]O−Or we could ask that [Flynn] to
take care of all the demons!
[END]
3: (Weary man) [7a 63][13 1, 403841]Come to think of it, those awful kids
were a thorn in our side even before we
had the ceiling to worry about.
[->]I'm ashamed I made so much commotion
over a few piddly demons...
[->]Thanks to your heroic effort, champion,
I feel like I can be more positive about
things, like you.
[END]
4: (Weary man) [7a 63][13 1, 403841]We've lived in a city infested with
demons for years.
[->]Once Shibuya is back to normal, it'll
attract more of those awful kids.
[->]...But that's okay. I'll keep my chin
up from now on.
[END]
5: (Dreamy woman) [7a 80][13 1, 403122]The guys from the Ashura−kai have been
talking about some stuff ”above the
ceiling” recently...
[->]It never occurred to me there might be
something on the other side of the
ceiling...
[->]But if whatever's up there is more
comfortable than these underground
districts, I wanna go there...
[END]
6: (Dreamy woman) [7a 80][13 1, 403121]H−Hey, I hear Tayama and Yuriko are
having an all−out war. Is that right...?
[->]It's because of them that there are so
many demons in Tokyo now, isn't it?
[->]What? It isn't!? Then what's going on
here, really!? No one tells me anything!
[END]
7: (Dreamy woman) [7a 80][13 1, 403103]H−Hey, I hear Tayama and Yuriko aren't
in Tokyo anymore. Is that right...?
[->]But there is a guy called the King of
Tokyo, and he's killing all the demons
for us? Is that right?
[->]What? It isn't!? Then what's going on
here, really!? No one tells me anything!
[END]
8: (Dreamy woman) [7a 80][13 1, 403103]So Tayama and Yuriko aren't in Tokyo
anymore, right?
[->]And there's a guy called the King of
Tokyo who wants to help the city, right?
[->]What? No? Well, whatever. But it is true
that we can go back to our regular lives,
right?
[END]
100: (Weary man) [7a 63][13 1, 403841]Tayama, Yuriko, I don't care who does it,
just get the Reds out of Shibuya!
[->]It's because of those damn pills that
we're swamped with demons! I haven't had
a good night's sleep in years!
[->]Please, find some way that doesn't screw
over the locals...!
[END]
105: (Dreamy woman) [7a 80][13 1, 403103]I hear there's someone in Shinjuku who
went up above that ceiling. Is that
right...?
[->]But I guess since he's back in Tokyo,
that place isn't any better than
here, huh...?
[END]
205: (Dreamy woman) [7a 80][13 1, 403121]H−Hey, I hear Tayama and Yuriko are
having an all−out war. Is that right...?
[->]I hear there's someone in Shinjuku who
went up above that ceiling. Is that
right...?
[->]Couldn't we take shelter on the other
side of the ceiling? How can we get
there!?
[END]
