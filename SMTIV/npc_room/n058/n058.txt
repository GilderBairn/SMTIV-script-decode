0: (Spacey man) [7a 121][13 1, 403203]The Tennozu Shelter was a city
forsaken by everyone in Tokyo...
[->]But people have begun to come
lately...
[->]This must be the work of the
Red Knight. He truly is our messiah.
[END]
1: (Spacey man) [7a 121][13 1, 403203]We needed to offer a bull's head
as a sacrifice to Gozutennou.
[->]But we didn't have any cow heads...
We had to make a facsimile that
looked like one.
[->]We placed that over the head of the
person we used as a sacrifice, and
performed the ritual that way.
[END]
2: (Spacey man) [7a 121][13 1, 403203]You released us all from Gozutennou's
curse.
[->]This city is no longer forsaken.
I'm sure we can start over from the
beginning.
[END]
3: (Elderly man) [7a 63][13 1, 403811]The building [Color:0x5]south from here[Color:0x0] is where
the prayer ritual to Gozutennou takes
place.
[->]I'm sure that an outsider like
yourself has no place in there.
[END]
4: (Elderly man) [7a 63][13 1, 403813]Gozutennou has become angered and is
punishing us...
[->]It's all your fault!
What have you done!?
[END]
5: (Elderly man) [7a 63][13 1, 403823]We knew all this time that everything
had been a deception...
[->]Still, we had no other way to go on
living but to keep perpetuating that
lie...
[END]
6: (Bony woman) [7a 66][13 1, 403703]The Red Knight is going to resurrect
Gozutennou.
[->]Once that happens, we will all be
saved... Our long years of trouble
will pay off.
[END]
7: (Bony woman) [7a 66][13 1, 403703]The Red Knight gave us understanding
during our festivals.
[->]Oh, please come back...
Please, save us...
[END]
8: (Bony woman) [7a 66][13 1, 403713]Red Knight...! Red Knight...!
Where have you gone...?
[->]Please come back...
Please, save us...!
[END]
