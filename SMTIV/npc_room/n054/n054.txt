0: (Haggard man) [7a 79][13 1, 403613]They supposedly have membersâˆ’only
stores in the shopping district of
Ginza.
[->]I hear everything is pretty damn
pricy. Of course, I've never set
foot into one of them myself.
[->]I guess that the kind of people who
go to that kind of store would
usually be known as celebrities...
[END]
1: (Haggard man) [7a 79][13 1, 403613]I can't believe Lady Yuriko's been
defeated... How could anyone in this
world be so strong!?
[->]A weakling like me will never
survive... There's no way...
[END]
2: (Haggard man) [7a 79][13 1, 403613]To think that demons would come
pouring into Tokyo like this...
[->]A weakling like me will never
survive... There's no way...
[END]
5: (Confident woman) [7a 80][13 1, 404401]How could a frail woman like me come
all this way?
[->]Well, not even the Ring of Gaea
members can resist my feminine
charms.
[->]But I'm nothing compared to Lady
Yuriko, though...
[END]
6: (Confident woman) [7a 80][13 1, 404401]I was right to come to this city.
I can tell that I'll be able to
polish my skills even more.
[->]This is all thanks to Lady Yuriko.
We've lost such an amazing woman...
[END]
7: (Confident woman) [7a 80][13 1, 404441]This place is going to be overrun
by demons? Fine by me. Bring it on,
I say.
[->]Facing off against demons will help
me improve my skills even more...!
[END]
8: (Confident woman) [7a 80][13 1, 404431]I've thought back on Lady Yuriko's
beauty, and I've reached a conclusion.
[->]Strength isn't all about muscular
power. Looking at me, don't you
agree? Femininity is real strength.
[->]Men may be the ones that move this
world, but any man can be controlled
by a woman. That is the real power.
[END]
9: (Confident woman) [7a 80][13 1, 416100]So, a champion has been born among
the common folk?
[->]Well, then, since I've made it this
far on my own charms...
[->]I must be the champion of women.
[END]
10: (Demon) [7a 64930][13 1, 411201]I used to be human, but I became a
demon because I didn't want to be
under Tayama's control.
[->]And now that bastard lives the high
life, in my own home that he took
from me!
[END]
11: (Demon) [7a 65206][13 1, 411007]Tayama doesn't scare me, but he's
got... Uh... What are they called?
[->]Some kind of deadly demons.
They're insane.
[->]Whatever they are, Tayama has a lot
of those scary things.
[END]
109: (Confident woman) [7a 80][13 1, 416100]So, a champion has been born among
the common folk?
[->]Well, then, since I've made it this
far on my own charms...
[->]I must be the champion of women.
[END]
110: (Demon) [7a 64930][13 1, 411201]When the demons appear, only the
strong will survive. Of course, there
will still be inequality among people.
[->]Inequality... It must exist, in any
society. Things would be boring if
everyone was the same, right?
[END]
111: (Demon) [7a 65206][13 1, 411007]If Tayama's dead, then what happened
to his, uh... Those things he had.
Y'know...?
[->]Those crazy demons. Are they stuck
in their rock form?
[->]...You think maybe there's a way to
return them to normal and get them
to work for you?
[END]
210: (Demon) [7a 64930][13 1, 411201]To be honest, I don't care if I have
to live as a human or a demon. I just
don't want to be bored.
[->]But if the Demon Lord falls, will
humans reign again?
[->]Will I be caught like back then, too?
[END]
310: (Demon) [7a 64930][13 1, 411201]The Demon Lord has fallen, and humans
will reign again.
[->]But... Doesn't that mean that demons
will eventually be able to return to
this world?
[->]I think I'm going to get my foot in
the door and start a new business
here in the human world.
[END]
