0: (Demonoid man) [13 1, 411001]...Aah! Drinks after a hard day of
fighting hit the spot. I wonder how
many I killed today?
[->]Tomorrow it might be me who dies...
When I think about that... it makes
the drinks taste even better!
[END]
1: (Demonoid man) [13 1, 411001]Tokyo's virtually been taken over by
demons. The boss over in Shinjuku is
a big−shot demon from India.
[->]At first, everyone became demonoids,
hungry for power, so that we could take
Tokyo back from the demons.
[->]But then some of us got addicted to
power, and others were overwhelmed by
the demons and submitted to them.
[->]Oh, I'm no different. Everyone's
forgotten their initial enthusiasm and
now just runs amok doing whatever.
[END]
2: (Demonoid man) [13 1, 411000]Hey there, Intruder bros. I heard you
took over Shinjuku.
[->]Apart from the guys who are still here,
everyone else is picking up stakes and
moving there.
[->]I hear that most of the neurishers have
been transferred to Shinjuku too.
[END]
3: (Demonoid man) [13 1, 411000]Hey there, Intruder bros. I heard you
took over Ichigaya.
[->]I also heard that Akira's gonna move
there and take a bunch of guys from
Shinjuku with him.
[->]And right after they just finished
moving to Shinjuku, too... Oh well,
it's good news, really.
[END]
4: (Demonoid man) [13 1, 411001]Hey there, Intruder bro. Akira's all
done moving now.
[->]I think he wanted to see you, though.
Do me a favor and go pay him a visit
at Ichigaya.
[END]
5: (Demonoid man) [13 1, 415000]That thing on your arm... Nah, can't be.
I thought for a second that it was
a Demonica.
[->]But the Counter−Demon Force was wiped
out 25 years ago, and there's no way
Kenji'd overlook something like that.
[END]
6: (Demonoid man) [13 1, 415005]When Akira was a kid−−this is when he
was a human, I mean−−I heard he lost
his sister.
[->]The angels kidnapped her and trapped her
inside the cocoon...
[->]And thanks to Kenji killing the angels,
I heard that all the humans shut up
inside that cocoon rotted away.
[->]The cocoon's still somewhere in Shinjuku,
I'm pretty sure.
[END]

his sister.
[->]The angels kidnapped her and trapped her
inside the cocoon...
[->]And thanks to Kenji killing the angels,
I heard that all the humans shut up

[->]Avenging his sister might be one reason
Akira's so bent on becoming the King
of Tokyo.
[END]
8: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]If you're gonna wander around this
base, you'd at least better introduce
yourself to the boss.
[->]You'll find Akira in the room to the
left of this Association.
[END]
9: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]I don't care if you're an Intruder or
what. You up for doing some quests?
[->]Everyone here lives on the rule of ”take
what you want,” so they're not the types
who'll work for a reward.
[->]Just help us out, okay? You can go talk
to Akira first if you want, that's fine.
[END]
10: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]I don't care if you're an Intruder or
what. You up for doing some quests?
[->]Everyone here lives on the rule of ”take
what you want,” so they're not the types
who'll work for a reward.
[->]I know you're busy, what with trying to
take over Shinjuku and all, but spare
a little time for us too, okay?
[END]
11: (Bartemder) [13 1, 405120]Well, I'm glad Akira took Shinjuku...
[->]But Kasumigaseki's population dropped
pretty drastically, and we lost a lot
of guys willing to do quests.
[->]I know you're busy, what with trying to
kill Kenji and all, but spare a little
time for us too, okay?
[END]
12: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Well, I'm glad Akira's the new king
of Tokyo...
[->]But Kasumigaseki's population dropped
pretty drastically, and we lost a lot
of guys willing to do quests.
[->]Hey, Intruder bro. Since you're here
already... why not take on a few
quests?
[END]
