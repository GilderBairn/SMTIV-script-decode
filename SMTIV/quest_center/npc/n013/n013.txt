0: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Kenji had one hell of a fight in the
shop with a demon that used to be in
control of Ikebukuro...
[->]I'm finally done fixing the shop and
getting ready to open it for business
again. I hope you'll stop by often!

1: (Demonoid man) [13 1, 415109]It's better we don't tell the neurishers
about this ”equality” Akira talks about.
[->]We can't go back to our human selves,
so there's no point in stirring things
up with shit about ”human rights.”
[END]
2: (Demonoid man) [13 1, 415205]A bunch of the guys who were here got
killed by the ones who came from
Kasumigaseki.
[->]They swore up and down that they'd never
bow to a guy like Akira, after all...
[->]They may be Akira's old friends, but
wasn't that going a little far? They
acted more like fanatics.
[END]
