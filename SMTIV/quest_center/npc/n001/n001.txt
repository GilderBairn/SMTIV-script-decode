0: (K) [13 1, 405000]Ol' K's the one with a lesson to teach
today.
[->]First, have a look at the blackboard
behind the bar.
[END]
1: (K) [13 1, 405010]Eh? Where did the name ”K” originate?
Why, it's simply the order of things.
[->]The first bartender was A, the next
was B, then C... After these many
years, I, the current barman, am K.
[->]I'm not sure exactly how many cycles
have passed. It simply goes to show
you how long our history is.
[END]
2: (K) [13 1, 405000]It looks to me like you were the sole
winner of that ”contest.”
[->]Talking of which, where are Walter and
Navarre? The contest's over, but they're
still in Naraku...?
[END]
3: (K) [13 1, 405010]So, I heard that you ran afoul of a
demon's Domain?
[->]Whenever I hear that word ”Domain,”
I feel my arm and eye throb...
[->]No, it's something that happened long
ago. Before you were born, I'd wager.
[END]
4: (K) [13 1, 405010]That Hugo was once a Samurai too. Though
he was more effective with his brush
than his sword...
[->]He persuaded the king with his grand
righteousness and won the people's
support by claiming it was all for them.
[->]You see, he foresaw the people's response
and fixed it so that any who rejected
his ideals was branded an evildoer.
[->]...Too clever by half, if you ask me.
[END]
5: (K) [13 1, 405010]Hope's been coming by a lot lately.
He's been grumbling, that one...
[->]They can slay the people who've become
demons, but they can't prevent it from
happening to more of our kinsmen.
[->]Hugo's public execution is nothing more
than pageantry to turn the public eye
away from the true problem...
[->]But I don't mind temporary measures,
as long as they can stem the tide
of demons.
[END]
6: (K) [13 1, 405010][最近/さいきん] ホープがよく[顔/かお]だしてくれるんだ

[END]
7: (K) [13 1, 405010]Gabby's one of the Monastery's most
senior members. Nobody knows much
about her past, though.
[->]I recall asking her out to breakfast
when I was an active Samurai. I didn't
stand a chance, naturally.
[->]She's lost none of her beauty in the
years since... which is a bit eerie,
in truth. How old must she be now?
[END]
8: (K) [13 1, 405010]You'll find if you talk to the men in
the castle and the castle town, most of
them will speak of the new leaders.
[->]It may sound hard to credit, but everyone
had the same dream that night.
[->]I was no exception...
[END]
9: (K) [13 1, 405020]Speaking personally, I don't think that
those who are given power should act
selfishly.
[->]It tends to make the lives of those
around them miserable.
[->]You have power, too, ever since you
became a Samurai. Who will you use your
power on behalf of?
[END]
10: (K) [13 1, 405010]Hoy, Jonathan, [Flynn].
[->]I heard that the new leaders have
appointed you two to slay the Black
Samurai.
[->]It wasn't so long ago that you prentices
couldn't even use the blackboard...
And look at you now!
[->]I warn you, though. Your opponent is
a dreadfully clever woman who has
eluded our grasp at every turn.
[->]She'll be a handful, that one.
Go cautiously, all right?
[END]
11: (K) [13 1, 405020]We all had the same dream on the same
night again. A dream of a new millennium
brought about by the warrior of light.
[->]But the man who appeared in that dream
as a candidate to martyr himself to
become God's chariot...
[->]Perhaps I saw wrongly, but he seemed
to resemble Jonathan...
[END]
12: (K) [13 1, 405010]About what Isabeau said... How we're
all to live in Tokyo now...
[->]The irony may be that this is ultimately
thanks to the Literature the Black
Samurai brought, and our new leaders.
[->]If all our kingdom's people were alive
and well, this would be a futile
endeavor.
[->]It reminds me of the talk about how only
”God's chosen” can be saved. I don't
credit it... but I can't deny it.
[END]
13: (Prudent Samurai) [13 1, 403001]K was originally the Samurai's Commander.
His arm and eye were lost in honorable
combat...
[->]Even Sir Hope, our present Commander,
pales in comparison.
[END]
14: (Prudent Samurai) [13 1, 403001]This talk of more demons seen in Naraku
has in truth been cropping up for
some months.
[->]And now, a demon emerges who is capable
of erecting a Domain... I hope this
does not bode ill...
[END]
15: (Prudent Samurai) [13 1, 403001]I don't think that any have been awarded
the Third Order of Merit since K was an
active Samurai.
[->]With all the melancholy news of late,
your heroism is quite inspiring.
[END]
16: (Prudent Samurai) [13 1, 403001]I don't think that any have been awarded
the Third Order of Merit since K was an
active Samurai.
[->]With all the melancholy news of late,
your heroism is quite inspiring.
[END]
17: (Prudent Samurai) [13 1, 403001]Shene Duque is holy ground. It's said
to be the site in this kingdom closest
to God.
[->]Perhaps that's the reason that demons
have never been seen in Shene Duque.
[END]

[END]
19: (Prudent Samurai) [13 1, 403001]Thinking on it, the Eastern Kingdom of
Mikado and Tokyo were both distorted
in their own way.
[->]If that distortion is corrected, it
should be a thing to be welcomed.
[->]...Even if it means the end of our
home country.
[END]
20: (Talkative Samurai) [13 1, 403042]There is a clear divide between the
loud ones and the quiet ones in this
year's crop of prentices.
[->]Every time Walter and Navarre come
around, they say anything that pops
into their heads.
[->]Whereas Jonathan and Isabeau are oddly
quiet, it seems. I feel almost ashamed
to engage them in idle conversation.
[->]And then there's yourself, who is nearly
silent. I can't recall the last time I
met anyone who said so little.
[END]
21: (Talkative Samurai) [13 1, 403001]...Ho there, prentice.
[->]I... I am not daunted by the Black
Samurai. 'Tis just that she... is
a lady...
[->]A scoundrel who has wronged our kingdom
she may be, but my blade was not meant
to be wielded against the fairer sex.
[END]
22: (Talkative Samurai) [13 1, 403002]Ho there, prentice. I heard that you
have the Black Samurai in hand. Everyone
in the castle town is aquiver about it!
[->]Though your names haven't been spoken.
I suppose that is how the Monastery
does things...
[->]But I know quite well the names of
our kingdom's heroes.
[END]
23: (Talkative Samurai) [13 1, 403001]Sister Gabby has given the order to keep
the Black Samurai's resurrection a grave
secret.
[->]S−Still, I believe the people should
be told...
[->]This is a dire situation that requires
caution on the part of the people. I see
no reason to hide this from them.
[END]
24: (Talkative Samurai) [13 1, 403042]Ho there, prentice... Ah, but my
mistake. You're no prentice, not now.
Are you alone today?
[->]Jonathan's gone to the entrance of
Naraku and Walter, it seems, has
retired to the barracks.
[->]Well, you've spent enough time on the
same missions thus far. Take some time
for yourself once in a while.
[END]
25: (Talkative Samurai) [13 1, 403001]Ah, [Flynn]. Our new leaders
speak very highly of you.
[->]Not only did you give the new Terminal
its name, you've become a blessed
warrior of light.
[->]You've uttelry overshadowed me. As a
fellow Samurai, it's quite vexing...
Yet I'm not entirely unhappy.
[END]
26: (Talkative Samurai) [13 1, 403001]Ah, it's you, [Flynn].
Was what Isabeau said true...?
[->]But you named the new Terminal...
You two were awarded the Third Order
of Merit together...
[->]Very well, I'll believe you. Who am I
to doubt the words of my proud fellows?
[END]
27: (Old−looking Samurai) [13 1, 403001]Hoy, prentice. Let me give you a little
advice as a Master.
[->]”Don't get upset at everything the
Monastery does.” You'll see what I
mean by that in time...
[END]
28: (Old−looking Samurai) [13 1, 403002]Until now, the Samurai mostly came to
us from the ranks of the Luxurors.
[->]I'm not condoning what Navarre and his
cronies did... but they probably didn't
understand.
[->]This may have been their first time
coming into contact with Casualries,
after all.
[END]
29: (Old−looking Samurai) [13 1, 403002]That young lady next to Hugo at the
emergency meeting... Gabby, yes?
[->]I've heard of her before, but this is
the first I've seen of her in person.
[->]If Hugo keeps her close by, she must
be able indeed.
[END]
30: (Old−looking Samurai) [13 1, 403002]Sister Gabby's administration is nothing
short of miraculous.
[->]In such a short time, she made the
arrangements for such a large gathering
all on her own.
[->]Everything seems to fall perfectly into
place for her. It's as if she knew this
would happen from the start.
[END]
31: (Old−looking Samurai) [13 1, 403002]I won't be enjoying any drinks here
for much longer.
[->]They're sending Samurai out to each
region in a thorough hunt for the
Black Samurai.
[->]I'm to head up the search in Cebouia.
[END]
32: (Old−looking Samurai) [13 1, 403002]I was stationed in Cebouia to search
for the Black Samurai...
[->]But the villagers who had turned to
demons cut off our means of escape.
And then...
[->]A ray of light descended from the night
sky, followed by a deafening roar...
I'm ashamed to say I lost consciousness.
[->]When I awoke, I trembled at the sight
before me. Every last one of the demons
had disappeared.
[END]
33: (Old−looking Samurai) [13 1, 403002]The Eastern Kingdom of Mikado will return
to the olden days wherein the people and
angels joined hands to praise God.
[->]Seeing God's chariot with you is all
the proof that I require.
[END]
34: (Brotherly Samurai) [13 1, 403042]He is quite warmhearted now, but when
Mr. K was one of us... H−He was a terror
to behold.
[->]If he spotted any errors in our kit,
we would face his dreadful fists, 
excuses be damned...
[->]I can laugh about it now, but then...
I thought that Mr. K was more of a demon
than the actual beasts we hunted.
[END]
35: (Brotherly Samurai) [13 1, 403042]I saw myself the eastern skies turn
bluish−white... the bloodied people
collapsed upon the ground.
[->]It seems they intended to reach Mikado
Castle from another village, yet they
used all their strength at the gates.
[->]Those merciless wounds could not have
been dealt by humans. And some say there
are demons who can erect Domains afoot...
[->]I believe that the Commander decided on
his sudden departure in order to confirm
these recent rumors.
[END]
36: (Brotherly Samurai) [13 1, 403042]The Black Samurai has been apprehended.
This ought to be a time to raise a glass
in celebration...
[->]But K there seems to have a cloud over
his brow.
[END]
37: (Brotherly Samurai) [13 1, 403042]I've seen our Commander speaking directly
to Sister Gabby often of late.
[->]Given Hugo's penchant for self−
aggrandizement, I thought he would be
furious to be so upstaged...
[->]But on the contrary, 'twould seem he's
not exchanged words with Sister Gabby
at all.
[END]
38: (Brotherly Samurai) [13 1, 403202]Is something wrong with Isabeau? I saw
her standing alone at Obelisk Plaza.
[->]Don't tell me that romance is blossoming
amongst the Samurai... Honestly, don't.
I don't want to think about it...
[->]Then again, we owe it to our new leaders
that we can discuss such things now.
[END]
39: (Brotherly Samurai) [13 1, 403202]Is something wrong with Isabeau? I saw
her standing alone at Obelisk Plaza.
[->]Don't tell me that romance is blossoming

personally. You should be honored to
be counted among them.

46: (Armored Samurai) [13 1, 403042]Tensions have been at a fever pitch
between the Ashura−kai and Ring of Gaea,
the two main factions in Tokyo.

of boiling over...
[END]
47: (Armored Samurai) [13 1, 403042]They were recruiting for an urgent
mission before the Black Samurai was
slain...
[->]I nominated myself, but the Commander
chose Jonathan instead.
[->]Well, I can't fault his decision.
Jonathan is a particularly distinguished
member of our order, after all.
[END]
48: (Armored Samurai) [13 1, 403042]Our kingdom has God's chariot and the
warrior of light! How could we possibly
fall before the vile demons?
[->]Some of us here have begun celebrating
a trifle early. You should hurry to play
out your role...
[->]It won't be a celebration without you,
after all. Make sure to prepare some
tasteful remarks, yes?
[END]
49: (Isabeau) ...If only both wishes could come true.
That is a path I'd gladly walk...
[->]But such thoughts are naive. The world
is spun through our choices and
decisions.

102: (K) [13 1, 405010]Did I hear right that you and Walter
were ”taught a lesson” by the Masters?
[->]There was constant squabbling in my
day as well, but to think they'd band
together as a group to trick you...
[->]Well, it wouldn't have been done in
my day. I can't understand what the
young ones were thinking.
[END]
103: (K) [13 1, 405010]...The situation seems quite serious.
I heard from Hope about the ”Black
Samurai.”
[->]She has a Gauntlet and uses demons, eh?
In this kingdom, only Samurai are known
for those things...
[->]In which case, the Eastern Kingdom of
Mikado must have run afoul of a foreign
country.
[END]
104: (K) [13 1, 405022]...Take a look at the blackboard.
Hugo's added more official business.
[->]Hope will be leading the extermination
of demons in the various regions. That
much, at least, is a relief...
[->]But there's no denying that our kingdom
faces a crisis. He must have a deep and
abiding love for ”mystic relics”...
[END]
110: (K) [13 1, 405010]Hoy, Walter, [Flynn].
[->]I can tell simply by looking at your
faces that you're up to something.
[->]Let me give you a piece of advice as a
master Samurai. Don't do anything that
would be harmful to the kingdom.
[->]Then again, there is a bit in the
Samurai code about, ”If you commit to
a thing, see it through to the end.”
[->]I wonder which would apply in a case
such as this. I don't know... I suppose
it's for you to decide.
[END]
111: (K) [13 1, 405020]I've noticed a decline in customers
today. Is it because of the commotion
outside?

what's going on...
[->]A Samurai founded this kingdom, and it
will be a Samurai who draws the curtains
on it, eh...?

and say that I had a feeling this day
would eventually come...
[->]And if it has, then I am thankful to
see it happen in my lifetime.

124: (Talkative Samurai) [13 1, 403042]Ah, Jonathan. And [Flynn] too.
[->]I always see you two together. You should
value your friends when you're young.

memories with...

in life, after they're gone... you'll
end up a sad old man like me.

129: (Old−looking Samurai) [13 1, 403002]The true seeker of the Terminal and

one so young.

148: (Armored Samurai) [13 1, 403002]If the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado is not
long for this world, then this next
quest will be our last.

drunk this. You were called by the
Commander, no? You should go to him.
