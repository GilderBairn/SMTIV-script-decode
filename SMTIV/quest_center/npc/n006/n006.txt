you're from and why you came to Tokyo.

4: Tell him
Don't tell him

5: 〉 [Flynn] told the man about the
Eastern Kingdom of Mikado and that he's
come in search of the Black Samurai.
[END]
6: (Cold man) [13 0, 76030]Alright then. No, I'm sorry to have
bothered you.
[END]
7: (Cold man) [13 0, 76025]Alright... So in other words, you're
trying to get to the Counter−Demon
Force Base, right?
[END]
8: (Cold man) [13 0, 76026]That base is across the river south
of here, in Kasumigaseki.

10: (Cold man) [13 0, 76029]There is this quest, though, called
”Peallaidh Extermination.” Why not
give that one a try?
[END]
11: (Cold man) [13 1, 403002]You're not from around here, so I'll tell
you where Shinobazu Pond is...
[->]When you leave here, head left. Then go
right at the end of the corridor and it's
at the exit of the underground passage.
[->]There's a dock at Shinobazu Pond. That's
where you'll find that damn Peallaidh...
[END]
13: (Wide−eyed man) [13 1, 403032]Huh? A guy with an icy stare? Are you...
Are you talking about Jun?
[->]Don't kid around. Jun got eaten
by Peallaidh.
[END]
14: (Wide−eyed man) [13 1, 403002]I talked to a guy who came out from Sky
Tower and he said he was from ”above
the ceiling.”
[->]I figured a story like that was out−
there enough that I owed him a drink.
[->]I mean, Medusa's in there, you know?
How many people you think she's turned
to stone over the years?
[END]
15: (Wide−eyed man) [13 1, 403032]Th−This might not be news to you, but I
just found out that Medusa... she's dead,
isn't she?
[->]Now someone called the ”Demon Lord” has
shown up in town. Tokyo's done for...
[->]But this is no time to panic. I'm going
up above the ceiling. I'm sure I'll be
saved if I can make it there!
[END]
16: (Wide−eyed man) [13 1, 403002]Yo, champion. Looks like that Demon Lord
guy was sent packing.
[->]There was a point where I thought about
abandoning Tokyo and escaping to the
place above the ceiling...
[->]But I couldn't do it. It's taken me all
this time, but I've realized how much
I love Tokyo...
[END]
17: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403101]Hunters are basically handymen. It's the
one job you can do in Tokyo that still
puts food on the table.
[->]We look for stuff all over Tokyo and risk
our lives to slay powerful demons.
[->]Of course, we don't do it unless the
reward's nice enough, either.
[END]
18: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403102]So how long have you been working as
a Hunter? Are you making a name for
yourself yet?
[->]People might be talking about you now.
[->]If you're curious about your rep, try
asking him... That guy back there.
[END]
19: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403122]I heard the Ashura−kai and Ring of Gaea
were going to war, so I was thinking
about my future prospects.
[->]But there are so many more demons now
that I just don't have the time. I don't
even know if I'll live through the day...
[END]
20: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403102]Ah, [Flynn]...!
[->]This might sound sudden, but are you
single? I'm a pretty good Hunter, and
I can cook what I catch...
[->]Believe me, I don't go around using
that line on anyone, okay?
[END]
21: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403102]Ah, [Flynn]...!
[->]When I was younger, I never even thought
about it, but after the demons came,
I was more conscious about dying...
[->]So I started giving my own future
prospects more thought.
[->]By the way... are you single?
[END]
22: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]There was a weird guy walking around the
underground district. He said he came
from the ”Eastern Kingdom of Mikado.”
[->]I felt so sorry for him that I had to
buy him a drink.
[->]I can understand how he feels, but we're
Tokyo citizens until the day we die...
[END]
23: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]The path to becoming the champion Hunter
is long and treacherous.
[->]You know the Challenge Quests issued to
the Hunters in each region of Tokyo?
[->]You have to complete them all to prove
you've got the skills.
[->]If someone actually pulls that off, then
yeah, they'd definitely be worthy of
the ”champion” title.
[END]
24: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]At first, when people were talking about
the power of hope, I thought it was just
silly idealism.
[->]But if that's the power that drove off
the angels... Maybe there's something
to it after all.
[END]
25: (Bartender) [13 1, 405124]If you're gonna try being a Hunter, then
you should go check out the black market.
[->]The stuff they handle there all has a
shady past, but there's no doubt that
it's quality merchandise.
[->]There's an old man who runs a stall in
the underground district, if you're
interested.
[END]
26: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]...Hey there, rookie. I heard you were
the one to kill Peallaidh.
[->]Your eyes tell me you don't intend on
staying in Ueno.
[->]I won't stop you from going wherever
you're going, but if you come by again,
do us a favor and pick up a few quests.
[END]
27: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]...Hey there. Looks like you've been out
all the way to Shinjuku. Did you stop by
the Association there too?
[->]The quests on the bulletin board are
different from region to region.
[->]So if you're ever in a new region for
the first time, you should hit up the
bulletin board at their Association.
[END]
28: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Ever since that weird pillar of light
appeared, demons have been pouring out
of Ichigaya...
[->]What with the sudden influx of demons,
the Hunters seem to have lost their
motivation lately.
[->]We need to think of a way to remedy
that...
[END]
29: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, [Flynn]. Looks like
things are going pretty well for you.
[->]But a guy as strong as you, I'm sure
you can aim even higher.
[->]What you should try to do is make the
top three. You do that, and then this
tournament will really be something.
[END]
30: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, [Flynn]. Looks like
you've been keeping busy.
[->]Ever since you hit the top three,
folks have been talking about you.
[->]The other Hunters are starting to get
into the spirit of things too...
[->]Keep up the good work and help this
tournament really blow up.
[END]
31: (Bartender) [13 1, 405123]Hey, [Flynn]!
You've been on a roll!
[->]People have been talking about how you're
just a stone's throw from the champion's
title.
[->]The other Hunters are giving it all
they've got to keep up.
[->]So come on... you've come this far...
You're going for the championship,
right?
[END]
32: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, Tokyo's first champion.
You did good. Everyone I talk to in
Ueno has nothing but praise for you.
[->]Your deeds have given the people of
Ueno... or actually, everyone in
Tokyo, renewed hope.
[->]To think that the rookie who didn't even
know about bulletin boards would make
it all the way to the top!
[END]
33: (Cynical man) [13 1, 403202]You must be [Flynn], right?
The one who's got Tokyo buzzing...
[->]Sorry if this seems sudden, but are you
interested in finding out what the people
around you think about you?

34: (斜に構えた男) ちょいと[優/やさ]しすぎて ハンター[稼業/かぎょう]を
やっていけるのか[心配/しんぱい]になるぜ
[END]
35: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a very
polite man.
[->]Which is an admirable trait, but a little
bizarre in Tokyo right now.
[END]
36: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a hard
man to get a handle on.
[->]I've met all kinds, but people like you
are pretty rare.
[END]
37: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a real
hot−blooded type.
[->]Just like almost everyone in Tokyo...
That's how you get if you live here
whether you like it or not.

39: (Cynical man) [13 1, 403202]You must be [Flynn], right?
Yeah, I've seen you around.
[->]Sorry if this seems sudden, but are you
interested in finding out what the people
around you think about you?

[END]
41: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a very
polite man.
[->]I respect that, but here in this Tokyo...
It's pretty hard to stay that way.
[END]
42: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a hard
man to get a handle on.
[->]You go your own way, which is pretty
damn cool. Even though there aren't
many who would see things your way.
[END]
43: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a real
hot−blooded type.
[->]I don't know if you've always been like
that. It's just how you get if you live
here whether you like it or not.

45: (Cynical man) [13 1, 403202]Hey there, [Flynn]. Not a day
goes by that I don't hear about you.
[->]Sorry if this seems sudden, but are you
interested in finding out what the people
around you think about you?

[END]
47: (Cynical man) Everyone says you're a very polite man.
[->]Considering the state Tokyo is in, it's
rare that anyone like you still exists.
[END]
48: (Cynical man) Everyone says you're a hard man to get
a handle on.
[->]Which reminds me, there was another guy
I said the same thing to. He was a young
one too, about your age.
[END]
49: (Cynical man) Everyone says you're a real hot−blooded
type.
[->]The word is you're not from Tokyo, but
you've started to fit in even more than
some of the locals.

51: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 1, 400005]Hold on, you have a different quest
going on right now. Are you sure you
want to continue?
[END]
52: If you wish to proceed with the main
quest, you must abandon or complete the
the Challenge Quest in order to release
the hold placed on the main quest.
[END]
108: (Burroughs) [13 0, 86020]This seems like important evidence.
I'll make a note of it in the quest.
[END]
111: (Cold man) [13 0, 76033]Heh, the Counter−Demon Force...
There's something I haven't heard
about in a long time.
[END]
114: (Wide−eyed man) [13 1, 403002]I've been seeing that guy from ”above
the ceiling” more lately.
[->]I asked the Ashura−kai about it, and all
they said was ”You mean past Medusa?”
[->]Considering the state of Tokyo these
days, I wouldn't blame him for losing
touch with reality.
[END]
115: (Wide−eyed man) [13 1, 403032]Huh? The champion? What good's that
going to do you?
[->]Now someone called the ”Demon Lord” has
shown up in town. Tokyo's done for...
[->]But this is no time to panic. I'm going
up above the ceiling. I'm sure I'll be
saved if I can make it there!
[END]
118: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403122]If you're a Hunter too, then you must be
in the same bind I am.
[->]After what just happened, I've been
thinking about whether to side with
Tayama or Yuriko.
[->]So weird to be worrying about the future
even in this demon−infested hellhole...
[END]
119: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403122]The Ashura−kai and the Ring of Gaea are
both gone. So what should I do about
the future...?
[->]Well, maybe I'll give that Hunter
tournament a try.
[->]I might be able to do some networking
with the top−ranked Hunters, after all.
[END]
122: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403012]Guys who go around armed like us Hunters
must be a pain for the Ashura−kai...
[->]But the Association bartenders have it
all under control. They kick a little
back to the Ashura−kai under the table.
[END]
127: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]...Hey there. I heard you've been out
all the way to Ikebukuro. Do you know
about the Association there?
[->]They got attacked by demons and had to
close down. So don't expect to get any
work there.
[->]On the bright side, since Hunters don't
go here anymore, you can probably find
some nice, rare items.
[END]
132: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, Tokyo's first champion.
You really did an amazing job...
[->]The Association will probably have a lot
of time on its hands now. Though that's
really something to celebrate...
[END]
133: ”I'm interested.”
”I've no interest.

139: ”I'm interested.”
”I've no interest.”
[END]
145: ”I'm interested.”
”I've no interest.”
[END]
208: (Cold man) [13 0, 76027]But the Ashura−kai has destroyed most
of the bridges across Tokyo. Getting
across the river won't be so simple.
[->][13 0, 76029]There is this quest, though, called
”Peallaidh Extermination.” Why not
give that one a try?
[END]
214: (Wide−eyed man) [13 1, 403002]I hear Yuriko's been saying some strange
stuff. Something about people coming
from above the ceiling...?
[->]But the Ashura−kai have Medusa blocking
the entrance at Sky Tower.
[->]I don't think Yuriko knows what she's
talking about. You know what I mean?
[END]
215: (Wide−eyed man) [13 1, 403002]Yo, champion. As long as you're here,
Tokyo's peace is guaranteed.
[->]Medusa's gone too, so you're the only
one who can protect Tokyo now.
[->]I thought about escaping to the above
world through Sky Tower, but in the end,
I couldn't abandon Tokyo...
[END]
219: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403102]The Ashura−kai and the Ring of Gaea are
both gone. So what should I do about
the future...?
[->]For the moment, I'm participating in that
Hunter tournament. I've been networking
a little with the top−ranked Hunters.
[->]The one I'm watching right now is
[Flynn]. I definitely want to
get to know him...
[END]
227: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]You've been to Ginza? Then you might
already know this...
[->]But flashing a VIP card to parade
through the streets of Ginza sounds
pretty stylin'.
[->]To get that far, though, you'll need the
kind of cash reserves that'd make a man's
eyes bulge out.
[END]
233: (Cynical man) Then hear me out...
[END]
239: (Cynical man) Then hear me out...

245: (Cynical man) Then hear me out...

308: 〉 The cold man takes something from his
pocket and fiddles with it...

314: (Wide−eyed man) [13 1, 403002]I hear Yuriko's been saying some strange
stuff. Something about people coming
from above the ceiling...?
[->]But the Ashura−kai have Medusa blocking
the entrance at Sky Tower.
[->]Y−Yuriko doesn't get it at all. Medusa
will turn absolutely anyone to stone...
[END]
315: (Wide−eyed man) [13 1, 403002]Yo, champion. As long as you're here,
Tokyo's peace is guaranteed.
[->]Although that ”Demon Lord” is still
around, isn't he? Should I try escaping
through Sky Tower after all...?
[->]...Nah. I can't leave Tokyo behind.
[END]
333: (Cynical man) I see... Then we'll leave it at that.
[END]
339: (Cynical man) I see... Then we'll leave it at that.
