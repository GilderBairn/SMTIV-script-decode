0: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403001]I'm a survivor of the Counter−Demon
Force. Not a day goes by that I don't
think about what happened 25 years ago.
[->]I couldn't protect Tokyo from God's
wrath... I work as a Hunter now to
atone for that failure.

1: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403001]I'm a survivor of the Counter−Demon
Force. Not a day goes by that I don't
think about what happened 25 years ago.
[->]Before the angels left, they said,
”Let your wicked knowledge and fruits
of your wisdom perish with you.”
[->]And just like that, the nukes fell.
That's where all those scars in the
ground come from.
[->]I couldn't protect Tokyo from God's
wrath... I work as a Hunter now to
atone for that failure.
[END]
2: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403001]I couldn't protect Tokyo, or anywhere
in Japan, as a member of the Counter−
Demon Force.
[->]But from this day on, I'll protect my
homeland for the rest of my life.
[END]
3: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403001]I couldn't protect Tokyo, or anywhere
in Japan, as a member of the Counter−
Demon Force.
[->]But from this day on, I'll protect my
home... the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado...
for the rest of my life.
[END]
4: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403001]As an ex−soldier in the Counter−Demon
Force, I always saw demons as targets
to be exterminated.
[->]But nowadays, fighting demons is part
of everyday life. When I train each
day with my demons...
[->]Founding a new country in these desert
lands doesn't seem so much like grasping
at straws.
[END]
5: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]At one point, we looked to other nations
for backup, but God's wrath seems to
have hit on a global scale.
[->]The major world powers like America and
China are probably in a similar state.
[->]Wherever you guys came from, you should
be prepared to live here in Tokyo for
the rest of your lives.
[END]
6: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]It might be faster to go ahead with the
restoration on our own, rather than
expect support from other countries.
[->]I'm sure the other major powers like
America and China are dealing with the
same thing anyway.
[END]
7: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]We can't begin the restoration if we're
starving to death! We need to secure a
food supply first.
[->]Since we can't rely on imports from
other countries, I guess we'll have to
get self−sufficient.
[->]Our grain, meat, crops, and all the rest
will have to be produced domestically...
All for the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado!
[END]
8: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]If you're going to be in town, make sure
you at least say hello to our leader.
[->]Which is Kiyoharu, but... well, maybe
you should talk to Akira too.
[END]
9: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]For Akira, who usually shoulders all
the burden himself, to ask a favor
of you...
[->]It just goes to show how much faith he
has in you. We're all counting on you,
Messiah.
[END]
10: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, Messiahs. I've heard a lot
about your amazing deeds.
[->]Heh, Akira made a good call, huh?
[->]It's people like him who are destined
to lead.
[END]
11: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, Messiahs. I've heard a lot
about your amazing deeds. You killed
Pluto, right?
[->]Heh, Akira made a good call, huh?
[->]It's people like him who are destined
to lead.
[END]
12: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Messiah, you gotta hear this! Pluto's
gone...
[->]But now demons are coming from Ichigaya!
Looks like someone tampered with the
Yamato Reactor.
[->]Who could've done such a thing? We need
to make sure Akira gets whoever did this.
