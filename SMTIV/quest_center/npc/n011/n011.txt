0: (Demonoid man) [13 1, 412103]Kenji's damn strong, so it's pretty much
set that he's the number one man.
[->]The skirmishes going on now are just
people fighting over who gets to be
number two...
[->]But none of that changes the fact that
Shinjuku's doomed to be number two for
a while.
[END]
1: (Demonoid man) [13 1, 412109]Akira headed to Ichigaya. You're meeting
up with him, right?
[->]Word about Akira taking over Shinjuku
has spread. No matter where he goes now,
all the demons get out of his way.
[->]It was like that ”Ten Commandments”
vid I saw once. Akira looked so damn
confident as he walked off...
[END]
2: (Demonoid man) [13 1, 412101]Akira's back... and he's been crowned
King of Tokyo.
[->]Word about Akira killing Kenji has
spread. No matter where he goes now,
all the demons get out of his way.
[->]It was like that ”Ten Commandments”
vid I saw once. Akira looks like a real
man... now that he's holding up Tokyo.
[END]
3: (Demonoid man) [13 1, 412101]Akira's gone off to the castle where the
King of Tokyo usually sits.
[->]Word about Akira killing Kenji has
spread. No matter where he goes now,
all the demons get out of his way.
[->]But it was you guys who killed Kenji,
right? I had to stop myself from laughing
out loud when I found that out.
[END]
4: (Demonoid man) [13 1, 415105]Akira shouldn't go near Shinjuku if he
knows it'll make him feel bad.
[->]He used to go there even if it meant he
had to pick through garbage. I asked him
about it once 'cause it seemed weird...
[->]He said something like, ”I might as well
do it while I'm out visiting her grave.”
[END]
5: (Demonoid man) [13 1, 415100]You know, Akira muttered something weird
to himself the other day...
[->]”I won't be able to visit her grave for
a while.” What did that mean...?
[END]
6: (Demonoid man) [13 1, 415100]You know, Akira muttered something weird
to himself the other day...
[->]”I won't be able to visit her grave for
a while.” What did that mean...?
[END]
7: (Demonoid man) [13 1, 415100]That reminds me, Akira asked me to do
a weird favor for him the other day.
[->]He wanted me to pick up trash around
Shinjuku National Park for him every
now and then...
[->]I mean, I'll do it, since he told me to,
but he seemed strangely sad about it.
[END]
8: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]...Oh? Is a Demonica on your arm? Then I
guess that means you can handle quests.
[->]Most Intruders have died, and demonoids
don't command demons...
[->]So there's no one left to do our quests.
Help us out if you ever get the time.
[END]
9: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]...Oh? Hey there, Intruder bros.
If you've got a Demonica, that means
you can handle quests, right?
[->]Most Intruders have died, and demonoids
don't command demons...
[->]So there's no one left to do our quests.
Help us out if you ever get the time.
[END]
10: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]...Oh? Hey there, Intruder bros.
If you've got a Demonica, that means
you can handle quests, right?
[->]There might be a new King of Tokyo,
but there's still no one to take on
the quests here.
[->]When you've got time... well, you might
not have much, but if you do, help us
out a little, won't you?
[END]
