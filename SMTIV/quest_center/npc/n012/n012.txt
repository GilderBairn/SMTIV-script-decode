0: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Shibuya, Ikebukuro... All of Tokyo's regions
belong to the King, right?
[->]For Akira to bring the whole city
together when not even Kenji could...
Man.

1: (Demonoid man) [13 1, 415005]Ever since Akira became the king of
Tokyo, people have been talking about
”equality” a lot.
[->]If we were still in the old Tokyo,
”equality” would've been the word of
the year for sure.
[END]
2: (Demonoid man) [13 1, 415102]A Tokyo where everyone can be equal and
enjoy themselves, huh...?
[->]I've known Akira since even before he
became a demonoid.
[->]And there's a part of him that's weak,
so I bet that's why he's pushing this
so hard.
[END]
