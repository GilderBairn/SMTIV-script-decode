0: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403001]I don't know when it happened, but
there's a weird tower in Shinjuku
National Park now.
[->]Though it seems like an Ashura−kai
project, so I'd better not go sticking
my nose in.
[END]
1: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403001]A long while ago, there was a rumor
going around that some big−time demons
went at it near Shinjuku National Park.
[->]I think it was after then that I started
seeing that weird tower.
[END]
2: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403041]Oh, so you know Fujiwara...
[->]He's a nice guy, but don't let it fool
you−−he's sharp, too.
[->]He used to be a newspaper reporter.
I've heard he knows all about Tayama's
secrets, too.
[->]Fujiwara won't openly defy Tayama, which
is why Tayama won't do anything about
Fujiwara...
[->]But I bet Fujiwara's the only man left
in Tokyo who could shut that Tayama up.
[END]
3: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403001]The Hunters who answered Fujiwara's call
are fighting the demons around Shinjuku
in shifts.
[->]But demons are pouring endlessly out
of Ichigaya... If we don't deal with the
root of this, it'll wring us dry.
[END]
4: (ハンターの男) [13 1, 403001]あの[悪魔/あくま]どもを[追/お]い[返/かえ]したんだぜ
[信/しん]じられるかよ あんた?
[->]ハハハッ [何/なん]だよ…
[俺/おれ]たち やればできるんじゃないか
[END]
5: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]Beating the demon at the Metropolitan
Government Office was a bigger job
than it seemed.
[->]I heard the Hunters they sent there
ran away?
[->]I bet the Ashura−kai will be after those
idiots now, since the Hunters ruined
their reputation.
[END]
6: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]...I heard about what happened with the
thing at the government office. What a
debacle, huh?
[->]It's not public yet, but the Hunters
know. You fought someone in the
Ashura−kai, right?
[->]Yeah, they'll get physical if things
don't go their way. Though I guess they
tried it with the wrong people this time.
[END]
7: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]I've carried Reds to Shinjuku National
Park for the Ashura−kai before.
[->]I know there are a bunch of demons in
Tokyo that Tayama deals with...
[->]But that package had a shit−ton of Reds.
Whoever they're going to must be getting
the VIP treatment.
[END]
8: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]I've carried Reds to Shinjuku National
Park for the Ashura−kai before.
[->]I brought them all the way from Midtown
to Shinjuku. And that was a couple
hundred boxes, too!
[END]
9: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]Actually, there was a tournament to
determine the champion Hunter back when
the Association first got started.
[->]But in the end, they never crowned one,
and it got split into different
categories like it is now.
[END]
10: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]It's been 20 or so years since the
Association was founded, and at last,
we have a champion.
[->]We lost Tokyo's guardian because of that
wrath−of−God business, but now we have
a new star of hope...
[END]
11: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]It's been 20 or so years since the
Association was founded, and at last,
we have a champion.
[->]Which is great and all, but let's be
honest...
[->]What I'm really hoping for is a Tokyo
where we don't need one.
[END]
12: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403101]The Ashura−kai's confiscated almost all
the supplies from department stores
and malls.
[->]But those guys aren't so careful, so
there might be a few things left if you
come across any stores.
[END]
13: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403102]There used to be these things called the
”National Defense Divinities” in this
country.
[->]Before Tokyo was covered in bedrock,
it was a last−ditch plan...
[->]They were going to use powerful demons
as deadly weapons to counter invasions
from other countries.
[END]
14: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403102]Samurai and Hunters... We have pretty
similar roles.
[->]I'd rather think of Samurai as partners,
not competitors. What about you?
[END]
15: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there. Nice going, making it out
this far. Shinjuku's bad off enough to
need all the help we can get.
[->]If you're sure of yourself, will you
think about handling the matter of
the Corpses?
[END]
16: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there. Thanks for dealing with those
Corpses... You've got real promise.
[->]You seem pretty sure of yourself, so will
you think about taking care of the demon
at the Metropolitan Government Office?
[->]Talk to the Ashura−kai guy at the
shutters if you want to know more.
[END]
17: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, thanks for your hard work.
That business with the demon at the
government office made me think...
[->]It reminded me of the episode with the
sea monsters in that Ultra−something
show I saw once...
[->]Heh, what am I even talking about?
The point is, I'm thankful for what
you guys have done.
[END]
18: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, thanks for your hard work.
That business with the demon at the
government office made me think...
[->]It reminded me of the episode with the
sea monsters in that Ultra−something
show I saw once...
[->]Heh, what am I even talking about?
The point is, I'm thankful for what
you guys have done.
[END]
19: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]I've been hearing the name ”Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado” a lot lately.
[->]Looks like there's a few people from
there in Shinjuku too.
[->]If you run into any of them, make sure
you talk up the quests.
[END]
20: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, Samurai. That's a pretty
rare thing you've got.
[->]If you have one of those matchboxes,
it must mean Fujiwara wants to meet.
[->]You must be a big deal if you've caught
his attention...
[END]
21: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Lately, I've been seeing demons
everywhere in Shinjuku.
[->]They haven't shown any signs of making a
move on the underground districts yet...
[->]But it's unnerving to think that
Shinjuku's in the hands of demons now.
[END]
22: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, [Flynn]. Looks like
things are going pretty well for you.
[->]But a guy as strong as you, I'm sure
you can aim even higher.
[->]What you should try to do is make the
top three. You do that, and then this
tournament will really be something.
[END]
23: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, [Flynn]. Looks like
you've been keeping busy.
[->]Ever since you hit the top three,
folks have been talking about you.
[->]The other Hunters are starting to get
into the spirit of things too...
[->]Keep up the good work and help this
tournament really blow up.
[END]
24: (Bartender) [13 1, 405123]Hey, [Flynn]!
You've been on a roll!
[->]People have been talking about how you're
just a stone's throw from the champion's
title.
[->]The other Hunters are giving it all
they've got to keep up.
[->]So come on... you've come this far...
You're going for the championship,
right?
[END]
25: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, Tokyo's first champion.
You did good. Thanks to you, things
are picking up in Shinjuku.
[->]Though there's still cause for concern.
Like Armageddon between the angels of
the Firmament and the demons...
[->]There weren't many of them, but a few
demons have climbed the Sky Tower.
[END]
26: (Cynical man) [13 1, 403202]You must be [Flynn], right?
The one who's got Tokyo buzzing...
[->]Sorry if this seems sudden, but are you
interested in finding out what the people
around you think about you?
[END]
27: (斜に構えた男) ちょいと[優/やさ]しすぎて ハンター[稼業/かぎょう]を
やっていけるのか[心配/しんぱい]になるぜ
[END]
28: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a very
polite man.
[->]Which is an admirable trait, but a little
bizarre in Tokyo right now.
[END]
29: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a hard
man to get a handle on.
[->]I've met all kinds, but people like you
are pretty rare.
[END]
30: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a real
hot−blooded type.
[->]Just like almost everyone in Tokyo...
That's how you get if you live here
whether you like it or not.
[END]
31: (斜に構えた男) [血/ち]に[飢/う]えすぎて [危険/きけん]な[予感/よかん]がするぜ
オマエ [本当/ほんとう]に[大丈夫/だいじょうぶ]か?
[END]
32: (Cynical man) [13 1, 403202]You must be [Flynn], right?
Yeah, I've seen you around.
[->]Sorry if this seems sudden, but are you
interested in finding out what the people
around you think about you?
[END]
33: (斜に構えた男) この[東京/とうきょう]でお[前/まえ]ほどのカタブツは
[見/み]たことがないって もう[評判/ひょうばん]だぜ
[END]
34: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a very
polite man.
[->]I respect that, but here in this Tokyo...
It's pretty hard to stay that way.
[END]
35: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a hard
man to get a handle on.
[->]You go your own way, which is pretty
damn cool. Even though there aren't
many who would see things your way.
[END]
36: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a real
hot−blooded type.
[->]I don't know if you've always been like
that. It's just how you get if you live
here whether you like it or not.
[END]
37: (斜に構えた男) お[前/まえ]の[行/い]く[所/ところ] [血/ち]と[暴力/ぼうりょく]が[渦巻/うずま]くって
こりゃまた[随分/ずいぶん]な[評判/ひょうばん]だぜ
[END]
38: (Cynical man) [13 1, 403202]Hey there, [Flynn]. Not a day
goes by that I don't hear about you.
[->]Sorry if this seems sudden, but are you
interested in finding out what the people
around you think about you?
[END]
39: (斜に構えた男) [法/ほう]と[秩序/ちつじょ]の[申/もう]し[子/ご]たるサムライだって
もはや[畏敬/いけい]の[象徴/しょうちょう]になってるぜ
[END]
40: (Cynical man) Everyone says you're a very polite man.
[->]Considering the state Tokyo is in, it's
rare that anyone like you still exists.
[END]
41: (Cynical man) Everyone says you're a hard man to get
a handle on.
[->]Which reminds me, there was another guy
I said the same thing to. He was a young
one too, about your age.
[END]
42: (Cynical man) Everyone says you're a real hot−blooded
type.
[->]The word is you're not from Tokyo, but
you've started to fit in even more than
some of the locals.
[END]
43: (斜に構えた男) [血/ち]に[染/そ]まりし[暴虐/ぼうぎゃく]のサムライだって
もはや[恐怖/きょうふ]の[象徴/しょうちょう]になってるぜ
[END]
101: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403001]A long while ago, there was a rumor
going around that some big−time demons
went at it near Shinjuku National Park.
[->]It seems three angels from the ceiling
attacked Tokyo.
[->]But I guess they were weakened, because
they got taken down instead.
[END]
102: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403001]It seems like Fujiwara's staying out of
this spat between Tayama and Yuriko.
[->]All it would take would be for him to
give the word, and he could mobilize
Tokyo's top Hunters, too.
[->]He must be biding his time... waiting
for just the right opportunity.
[END]
107: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]I've carried Reds to Shinjuku National
Park for the Ashura−kai before.
[->]Back then, Shibuya was seriously hot.
It was a Red Paradise!
[->]...But no thanks to that guy, it's back
to being a normal city now.
[END]
108: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]It's natural that Tayama would have the
know−how to make Reds.
[->]You do know that they were ginned up by
a pharmaceutical company, right? One of
the Ashura−kai's dummy corporations.
[->]...This was all before the ceiling
showed up, even.
[END]
109: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]Hey, that [Flynn] guy... The pace
he's finishing those quests at is nuts!
[->]If he keeps this up, he might really
make champion...
[END]
119: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]You're one of those Samurai folks, right?
There was a Samurai here the other day...
[->]But he got taken away by some guys from
the Ashura−kai.
[END]
120: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]If you've been checking the bulletin
board's rankings, you've probably seen
the name ”Skins.”
[->]The man you met at Florida is Skins
himself.
[->]Not only is he strong, he's very good
at using his demons by now.
[->]He's not some random salaryman who up
and joined the Hunters. I'll bet you he
was specially trained somewhere.
[END]
125: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, Tokyo's first champion.
You did good. Thanks to you, things
are picking up in Shinjuku.
[->]Though there's still cause for concern.
Like Armageddon between the angels of
the Firmament and the demons...
[->]Of the Hunters who've gone off to
Ichigaya, word is that none of them
made it back alive.
[END]
126: ”I'm interested.”
”I've no interest.”
[END]
132: ”I'm interested.”
”I've no interest.”

138: ”I'm interested.”
”I've no interest.”
[END]
207: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]I've carried Reds to Shinjuku National
Park for the Ashura−kai before.
[->]I picked 'em up from where they're made
and brought 'em to Shibuya.
[->]Man, where did I pick them up from...?
It's no use, I can't remember now.
[END]
208: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]This rumor about a ”reactor under
Ichigaya” is pretty rich. It's owned
by the military, actually.
[->]Some say it's a next−gen plasma weapon,
or that it's actually a ritual altar
to summon demons...
[->]They said all kinds of things about it
in those magazines even before the
ceiling formed.
[END]
219: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Tayama's mad that you went into one of
the Ashura−kai's forbidden zones.
[->]Not because you didn't listen to them,
but because it might cause others to
take the Ashura−kai less seriously.
[->]They have a fancy name now, but they're
really nothing but yakuza. Hits to their
reputation piss them off the most.
[END]
225: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]I have a large reservation under
Fujiwara's name.
[->]Looks like he's planning a reception
for VIPs from above the ceiling.
[->]I can't serve them demon meat... Ugh,
just thinking of a new menu makes my
head hurt.
[END]
226: (Cynical man) Then hear me out...
[END]
232: (Cynical man) Then hear me out...
[END]
238: (Cynical man) Then hear me out...

326: (Cynical man) I see... Then we'll leave it at that.

332: (Cynical man) I see... Then we'll leave it at that.
