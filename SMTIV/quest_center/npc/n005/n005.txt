0: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403042]I passed by Tsukiji Hongwanji a moment
ago and it was oddly quiet. Isn't there
supposed to be a war starting soon?
[->]Could Yuriko have been...? Nah,
couldn't be.
[END]
1: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403042]I passed by Tsukiji Hongwanji a moment
ago and it was oddly quiet. Isn't there
supposed to be a war starting soon?
[->]The atmosphere there seemed like they
were very sure they'd win.
[END]
2: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403012]All this stuff about the ”champion” is
bullshit. I'm supposed to put doing
quests over my own safety?
[->]Anyone who'd fall for that is nothing
but the champion idiot, if you ask me.
[END]
3: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]All this stuff about the ”champion” is
bullshit. I'm supposed to put doing
quests over my own safety?
[->]Well... that's what I used to think,
but I really have to hand it to whoever
could pull all that off.
[->]That's why I really look up to you,
champion.
[END]
4: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]All this stuff about the ”champion” is
bullshit. I'm supposed to put doing
quests over my own safety?
[->]Well... that's what I used to think,
but I really have to hand it to whoever
could pull all that off.
[->]That's probably the reason Masakado
was willing to help you.
[END]
5: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]You've even beaten that Demon Lord guy.
There's no one who could take you now.
[->]On top of that, you're the champion
who's been accepted by the guardian
of Tokyo...
[->]Even your name has power now. Make sure
you don't get taken advantage of by any
unsavory types, all right?
[END]
6: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403101]Have you ever been to Kasumigaseki?
[->]I hear there's loads of supplies hidden
there that politicians stockpiled with
their filthy money.
[->]Politicians... There's something that's
useless in Tokyo today. Finders keepers,
right?
[END]
7: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403103]Looks like this ”Demon Lord” has been
resurrected in Ichigaya. Who'd go and
do a thing like that...!?
[->]I've done all right for myself as a
Hunter, but it's not like I'm a member
of the Counter−Demon Force or anything.
[->]I can't risk my life fighting demons...
[END]
8: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403141]Since you became champion, it seems like
the reputation of Hunters in general
has gotten a boost.
[->]Every time I go out for work, people
keep coming up to talk to me. It can
get a little nerve−wracking...
[->]I wanted to stay a carefree, independent
Hunter, but this... this isn't so bad.
[END]
9: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]There's a huge boulder in the middle of
the intersection... Have you seen it
already?
[->]What could it be? It's supposedly been
there since before the ceiling formed.
[END]
10: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]That huge boulder in the middle of the
intersection... What was that?
[->]Well, it doesn't matter now that there's
this huge fuss about demons.
[END]
11: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]There's a certain air about you...
You're one of those Samurai, no?
[->]Could you be here for the Ring of Gaea
entrance test? We'll see how strong you
folks from above really are.
[->]To get to Tsukiji Hongwanji, leave by
the southern passage and it'll be right
in front of you.
[END]
12: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]I heard that a kid about your age and
wearing clothes like yours headed for
Camp Ichigaya.
[->]If you want to get there, you exit Ginza,
head toward Shibuya, and then keep going
north.
[->]Didn't they declare war on Yuriko, though?
I think that kid might be in danger...
[END]
13: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Looks like Tayama set up a defensive
line at the Sendagaya Tunnel...
[->]They're ready for war all the way up
to there, I think.
[->]Take it from me and don't go anywhere
near the north of Shibuya.
[END]
14: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Looks like Yuriko's gone missing.
I thought those Ring of Gaea guys would
lose heart over that...
[->]But it was the total opposite. They're
all excited because some prophecy of
Yuriko's came true.
[->]Yuriko's cultivated an air of mystery by
not showing herself. She's got her cult
wrapped around her finger.
[END]
15: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, [Flynn]. Looks like
things are going pretty well for you.
[->]But a guy as strong as you, I'm sure
you can aim even higher.
[->]What you should try to do is make the
top three. You do that, and then this
tournament will really be something.
[END]
16: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, [Flynn]. Looks like
you've been keeping busy.
[->]Ever since you hit the top three,
folks have been talking about you.
[->]The other Hunters are starting to get
into the spirit of things too...
[->]Keep up the good work and help this
tournament really blow up.
[END]
17: (Bartender) [13 1, 405123]Hey, [Flynn]!
You've been on a roll!
[->]People have been talking about how you're
just a stone's throw from the champion's
title.
[->]The other Hunters are giving it all
they've got to keep up.
[->]So come on... you've come this far...
You're going for the championship,
right?
[END]
18: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, Tokyo's first champion.
You did good. Thanks to you, things
are picking up in Ginza.
[->]Or, well... maybe not as much as some
other regions. I guess this is the
Ring of Gaea's turf, after all...
[->]Sure, they respect your achievements,
but they're still all about ”Lady
Yuriko.”
[END]
19: (Cynical man) [13 1, 403202]You must be [Flynn], right?
The one who's got Tokyo buzzing...
[->]Sorry if this seems sudden, but are you
interested in finding out what the people
around you think about you?
[END]
20: (斜に構えた男) ちょいと[優/やさ]しすぎて ハンター[稼業/かぎょう]を
やっていけるのか[心配/しんぱい]になるぜ
[END]
21: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a very
polite man.
[->]Which is an admirable trait, but a little
bizarre in Tokyo right now.
[END]
22: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a hard
man to get a handle on.
[->]I've met all kinds, but people like you
are pretty rare.
[END]
23: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a real
hot−blooded type.
[->]Just like almost everyone in Tokyo...
That's how you get if you live here
whether you like it or not.

25: (Cynical man) [13 1, 403202]You must be [Flynn], right?
Yeah, I've seen you around.
[->]Sorry if this seems sudden, but are you
interested in finding out what the people
around you think about you?
[END]
26: (斜に構えた男) この[東京/とうきょう]でお[前/まえ]ほどのカタブツは
[見/み]たことがないって もう[評判/ひょうばん]だぜ
[END]
27: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a very
polite man.
[->]I respect that, but here in this Tokyo...
It's pretty hard to stay that way.
[END]
28: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a hard
man to get a handle on.
[->]You go your own way, which is pretty
damn cool. Even though there aren't
many who would see things your way.
[END]
29: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a real
hot−blooded type.
[->]I don't know if you've always been like
that. It's just how you get if you live
here whether you like it or not.

[END]
31: (Cynical man) [13 1, 403202]Hey there, [Flynn]. Not a day
goes by that I don't hear about you.
[->]Sorry if this seems sudden, but are you
interested in finding out what the people
around you think about you?
[END]
32: (斜に構えた男) [法/ほう]と[秩序/ちつじょ]の[申/もう]し[子/ご]たるサムライだって
もはや[畏敬/いけい]の[象徴/しょうちょう]になってるぜ
[END]
33: (Cynical man) Everyone says you're a very polite man.
[->]Considering the state Tokyo is in, it's
rare that anyone like you still exists.
[END]
34: (Cynical man) Everyone says you're a hard man to get
a handle on.
[->]Which reminds me, there was another guy
I said the same thing to. He was a young
one too, about your age.
[END]
35: (Cynical man) Everyone says you're a real hot−blooded
type.
[->]The word is you're not from Tokyo, but
you've started to fit in even more than
some of the locals.

102: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403012]All this stuff about the ”champion” is
bullshit. I'm supposed to put doing
quests over my own safety?
[->]And the thing is, they're actually
getting people to do it! Meanwhile,
I'm...
[END]
108: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403112]If someone out there wants to shoot for
the champion title, they can knock
themselves out.
[->]I just want to stay a carefree,
independent Hunter. Plus...
[->]Tokyo's going to belong to the demons
soon anyway, right?
[END]
110: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]That huge boulder in the middle of the
intersection... What was that?
[->]Well, it doesn't matter now that there's
this huge fuss about demons.
[END]
111: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]I heard you passed the entrance test.
Sounds like I had you all wrong...
[->]Well, don't take it personally. Why not
pick up a few quests to celebrate your
success?
[END]
118: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, Tokyo's first champion.
You did good. Thanks to you, Ginza's
back to normal...
[->]Hah, I wish. Those Ring of Gaea loons
are the same as ever...
[->]They've chosen to stick to their guns,
huh? I don't think I could do that in
this situation... but I respect that.
[END]
119: ”I'm interested.”
”I've no interest.

125: ”I'm interested.”
”I've no interest.”

133: ”I'm interested.”
”I've no interest.”

208: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403141]Since you became champion, it seems like
the reputation of Hunters in general
has gotten a boost.
[->]I get a lot of civilians coming up to me
lately, saying stuff like ”Please keep
Tokyo safe,” and all that.

independent Hunter, but I don't
think I can anymore.
[END]
210: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]That huge boulder in the middle of the
intersection... What could it be?
[->]I saw a man with patchy skin muttering
”Masa−something” to it once.
[END]
211: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]What's with the scary look? Are you
gonna go kill Yuriko or something?
[->]...Huh? Seriously?
[->]Uh, okay then... You'll probably find
her in Tsukiji Hongwanji, along with
all the groupies who protect her.
[END]
219: (Cynical man) Then hear me out...

225: (Cynical man) Then hear me out...

310: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]That huge boulder in the middle of the
intersection... Huh? That was Masakado?
[->]I−I learned about it on my smartphone...
[->]Man, I've kicked that boulder before when
I got frustrated over losing track of
my target demon.
[->]I−I hope he's a good sport...!
[END]
311: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]What's with the solemn looks? You two
look like you just ran away from home.
[->]...Huh? Seriously?
[->]But aren't you two in the Ring of Gaea?
Just go over to Tsukiji Hongwanji.
[END]
319: (Cynical man) I see... Then we'll leave it at that.

325: (Cynical man) I see... Then we'll leave it at that.

[->]If you could get Masakado, the guardian

be set for life.

something, Masakado would put a stop
to it right quick.
