0: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]The event they held at Club Milton
basically only invited demons...
[->]But if you do quests for the Ashura−kai,
they'll invite you sometimes too.
[->]It's a rare opportunity for us plain
folks to drink real booze.
[->]Throwing bones like that is one of the
smart ways Tayama has of doing things.
[END]
1: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403012]The war between the Ashura−kai and the
Ring of Gaea was a pillow fight compared
to what we got now...
[->]Tokyo's turned into a nest of demons.
And Reds have been showing up in Shibuya
as well...
[->]The way things are now, you never know
when the guy next to you might suddenly
turn into a demon!
[END]
2: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403012]Even though there's some hope, it
doesn't change the fact that Tokyo
is dangerous...
[->]The city's turned into a nest of demons.
And Reds have been showing up in Shibuya
as well...
[->]The way things are now, you never know
when the guy next to you might suddenly
turn into a demon!
[END]
3: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]Even if all the demons up and left, it
wouldn't change the fact that Tokyo is
dangerous...
[->]Reds have been going out all across
Tokyo from Shibuya, after all.
[->]There's all kinds of reasons to lose hope
and get desperate in times like these...
[->]And guys like that are likely to turn
into demons when you least expect it.
That's the situation we're in now.
[END]
4: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403112]Camp Ichigaya is a real dangerous place.
Who'd ever want to go near it?
[->]The Ashura−kai guards it year round, and
I hear demons are wandering all over the
place inside.

[END]
6: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403103]Hey, you hear what happened to Tayama?
He was found dead in Ichigaya...
[->]Does that mean his room in Roppongi
is up for grabs?

[END]
10: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403042]It makes sense that even Tayama had
trouble dealing with the demon who took
over Club Milton.
[->]It's supposedly a badass demon that was
being supervised by that... Counter−
something Force.
[END]
11: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403042]There's this topic that's come up in
our group before. What makes a skilled
Hunter?
[->]Someone who makes great stuff? Or one
who can win against strong demons?
Or an expert at fusion...?
[->]But now that this tournament is going on,
whoever takes first place is definitely
the most skilled Hunter, no question.
[END]
12: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403042]I went to Ichigaya the other day,
because there's supposedly a big−time
demon there...
[->]But I ended up coming back. My Hunter's
intuition told me, without even going
inside...
[->]That the demons inside would be totally
out of my league...
[END]
13: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, guy. You're [Flynn],
right...?
[->]Tayama's got his eye on you. Better be
careful you're not dragged into trouble.
[END]
14: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]You went beneath Roppongi, I hear?
Tell me, was there a weird demon
down there?
[->]It looks weird and talks even weirder,
but it's definitely a tough customer.
[->]I won't tell you twice: don't think
about trying for revenge on it.

[END]
16: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]The Reds distribution channel... I hear
that place beneath Roppongi is still
completely operational.
[->]Considering there are more demons in
Tokyo now, Club Milton must be brimming
with customers.
[->]Though in a way, the Reds Tayama left
behind might be what saves Tokyo...
[END]
17: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, [Flynn]. Looks like
things are going pretty well for you.
[->]But a guy as strong as you, I'm sure
you can aim even higher.
[->]What you should try to do is make the
top three. You do that, and then this
tournament will really be something.
[END]
18: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, [Flynn]. Looks like
you've been keeping busy.
[->]Ever since you hit the top three,
folks have been talking about you.
[->]The other Hunters are starting to get
into the spirit of things too...
[->]Keep up the good work and help this
tournament really blow up.
[END]
19: (Bartender) [13 1, 405123]Hey, [Flynn]!
You've been on a roll!
[->]People have been talking about how you're
just a stone's throw from the champion's
title.
[->]The other Hunters are giving it all
they've got to keep up.
[->]So come on... you've come this far...
You're going for the championship,
right?
[END]
20: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, Tokyo's first champion.
You did good. Thanks to you, things
are picking up in Shibuya.
[->]There's no reason for us to curry favor
with demons using the Reds. We have
real hope in Tokyo now...
[END]
21: (Cynical man) [13 1, 403202]You must be [Flynn], right?
The one who's got Tokyo buzzing...
[->]Sorry if this seems sudden, but are you
interested in finding out what the people
around you think about you?
[END]
22: (斜に構えた男) ちょいと[優/やさ]しすぎて ハンター[稼業/かぎょう]を
やっていけるのか[心配/しんぱい]になるぜ
[END]
23: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a very
polite man.
[->]Which is an admirable trait, but a little
bizarre in Tokyo right now.
[END]
24: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a hard
man to get a handle on.
[->]I've met all kinds, but people like you
are pretty rare.
[END]
25: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a real
hot−blooded type.
[->]Just like almost everyone in Tokyo...
That's how you get if you live here
whether you like it or not.

Yeah, I've seen you around.

around you think about you?

29: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a very
polite man.
[->]I respect that, but here in this Tokyo...
It's pretty hard to stay that way.
[END]
30: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a hard
man to get a handle on.
[->]You go your own way, which is pretty
damn cool. Even though there aren't
many who would see things your way.
[END]
31: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a real
hot−blooded type.
[->]I don't know if you've always been like
that. It's just how you get if you live
here whether you like it or not.

33: (Cynical man) [13 1, 403202]Hey there, [Flynn]. Not a day
goes by that I don't hear about you.

[END]
35: (Cynical man) Everyone says you're a very polite man.
[->]Considering the state Tokyo is in, it's
rare that anyone like you still exists.
[END]
36: (Cynical man) Everyone says you're a hard man to get
a handle on.
[->]Which reminds me, there was another guy
I said the same thing to. He was a young
one too, about your age.
[END]
37: (Cynical man) Everyone says you're a real hot−blooded
type.
[->]The word is you're not from Tokyo, but
you've started to fit in even more than
some of the locals.

100: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]I hear Tayama looks over the bulletin
board rankings pretty regularly.
[->]When he finds a Hunter who seems
promising, he invites him for a chat.
[->]The Association set up the Hunter thing
as a way of surviving in Tokyo...
[->]But lately there are guys who sign up
as Hunters just to get close to Tayama.
[END]
110: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403042]After you defeated Koga Saburo, that
Ashura−kai guy went in to get something.
[->]Some people say there are demons that
you need a special item to control...
[->]Think it had something to do with that?
[END]
111: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403042][Flynn] was in the top three...
This might be because the others are
feeling inspired by his example...
[->]But the other Hunters seem to be getting
stronger too.
[->]If the quality of Hunters increases,
we'll have nothing to fear from any
demon in Tokyo!
[END]
113: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, guy. I heard you received an
invitation from Tayama.
[->]I didn't think anyone besides the
Ashura−kai would ever get into Roppongi.
[->]...Hopefully they'll let you back out
when they're done.
[END]
120: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, Tokyo's first champion. Nah,
you're more like a savior now, huh?
[->]If Fujiwara's right... the ceiling's
going to go away, right?
[->][13 1, 405123]Maybe I should quit working for the
Association and start a new career.
[->]Don't you think I could make some good
cash selling stuff like sunglasses or
suntan lotion?

121: ”I'm interested.”
”I've no interest.”

127: ”I'm interested.”

133: ”I'm interested.”
”I've no interest.”
[END]
200: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403012]Now that Koga Saburo's gone, Tayama's
taken back his base of operations for
supplying Reds.
[->]Yuriko seems confident in her victory
because of this ”son of carnage” who
she claims is coming.
[->]Both sides have a lot of pent−up
resentment, so this might well be
the end of Tokyo...
[END]
210: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403042]After you defeated Koga Saburo, that
Ashura−kai guy went in to get something.
[->]Some people say there are demons that
you need a special item to control...
[->]Think the Ashura−kai wants to take
control of Koga Saburo themselves?
[END]
211: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403041]Hey there, champion. Let me be the first
to congratulate you.
[->]You seem to have ties with Masakado
as well... Man, a Samurai who knows
the guardian of Tokyo...
[->]I'd say we were up against an unbeatable
opponent from the start.
[END]
213: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]...Hey there, guy. You met with Tayama,
right?
[->]You're cozying up to a dangerous man.
Make sure he doesn't suck you dry and
toss you aside.
[END]
221: (Cynical man) Then hear me out...

227: (Cynical man) Then hear me out...

233: (Cynical man) Then hear me out...
[END]
310: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403042]I may have been seeing things... but I
saw Koga Saburo.
[->]It was at the Sendagaya Tunnel, north
of Shibuya.
[->]It was weird... He seemed even more
threatening than before for some reason.
[END]
313: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]...Hey there. You went beneath Roppongi,
I hear? They tell me you had a pretty
hard time of it there.
[->]You're the first one to go down there
and come back alive.
[->]Well, whatever your reasons, it's best
you steer clear of there from now on.
[END]
321: (Cynical man) I see... Then we'll leave it at that.
[END]
327: (Cynical man) I see... Then we'll leave it at that.
