this world.
[->]So began the war for control between
the angels and the demons, eventually
leading to a world war among humanity.
[END]
306: (Stephen) [7a 1]...And now, a certain country has
just launched some of the worst weapons
known to man.
[->]Unfortunately... One of them is heading
directly towards Tokyo.
[->]Soon, it will destroy this city...
[END]
307: (Stephen) [7a 1]...But, turn around.
[END]
308: 〉 A giant demon fills your sight...
[END]
309: (Stephen) [7a 1]That enormous god is the guardian of
Tokyo, Masakado.
[->]He is trying to cover the entire city
of Tokyo with his body in order to
protect it from the missile.
[END]
310: (Stephen) [7a 1]However, he has lost control of himself,
just as the people of Tokyo have lost
themselves...
[->]If the missile reaches Tokyo, any
future the city may have had will
dissolve into mere possibility.
[END]
311: (Stephen) [7a 14]I believe you can bring Masakado back
to himself.
[->]If you were to challenge him, I am
sure he will respond.
[->]Are you willing to fight Masakado?
[END]
312: Fight Masakado
Don't fight Masakado
[END]
313: (Stephen) [7a 14]...I see.
[->]Then you must hurry. There is no time.
[END]
314: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 1, 400003]I will let you know how long we have
before the missile impacts.
[->]You just concentrate on the fight,
Master [Flynn].

improved while I was away.

Tokyo...
[END]
400: 〉 Masakado has changed himself into a
barrier enveloping all of Tokyo.
[END]
401: (Stephen) [7a 14]And so, Tokyo will follow the path of
history that you and I are familiar
with.
[->]A history where the Eastern Kingdom of
Mikado is founded on Masakado's back,
and where you will one day be born.
[END]
402: 〉 You hear the voice of Masakado
echoing around you...
[END]
403: (Masakado) [7a 1]Tokyo has been protected...
However, good and evil still remain.
[->]The souls of humanity will be tortured
by the hardships to come, due to the
neverending battle of law and chaos.
[->]However, you have left them with the
greatest of all gifts: hope.
[->]As long as there is hope, the Goddess
will never die.
[END]
404: (Masakado) [7a 1][Flynn]...
I shall grant you my ”shadow.”
[->]Use it as your shield in battle.

when you belong.
[->]Thank you... both of you.

this time.

”Tokyo” still needs your help, after
all...

explanation of the battle system?
[->][END]
1: Listen to it
Don't listen to it
[END]
2: Your team's turn will now begin.
First, look at the upper right corner.
[->]The green icon displayed here shows the
[Color:0x5]number of times you can act this turn.[Color:0x0]
These icons are called [Color:0x5]Press Turn Icons.[Color:0x0]
[->]There is currently [Color:0x5]1[Color:0x0] icon, showing that
you can [Color:0x5]act once[Color:0x0] this turn. Select
[Color:0x5]Attack[Color:0x0] from the command list to attack
the enemy.
[END]
3: You succeeded in damaging the enemy.
[->]Look at the Press Turn Icon. The icon
that was there before has disappeared.
[->]One icon equates to one action, so using
that attack expended one icon.
[END]
4: [先/さき]ほどスライムに[攻撃/こうげき]したときとは[違/ちが]い
[緑/みどり]のアイコンが1[回/かい]の[攻撃/こうげき]で1[個/こ]
[消費/しょうひ]されました
[->][緑/みどり]のアイコンの[数/かず]が0になりましたので
[味方/みかた]が[行動/こうどう]できる[回数/かいすう]は[増/ふ]えることなく
[敵/てき]の[行動/こうどう]ターンが[開始/かいし]されます
[END]
5: You damaged the enemy and struck its
weakness as well.
[->]Look at the Press Turn Icon. It should
be shining brightly, indicating that
[Color:0x5]you can act once more.[Color:0x0]
[->]By attacking with [Color:0x5]an element the enemy
is weak against,[Color:0x0] a normal icon will begin
to shine and you can act once more.
[->]In this case, because [Color:0x5]the Slime was weak
to the Phys element[Color:0x0] of [Flynn]'s
normal attack, the icon shined and [Color:0x5]you
can act once more.[Color:0x0]
[->][END]
6: The number of Press Turn Icons has been
reduced to 0.
[->]You have no more icons showing your
number of actions, which ends your turn.
The enemy's turn will begin now.
[END]
7: Attacking the Slime was different from
attacking Lham Dearg in that you struck
its weakness and the Press Turn Icon
shined, allowing you to act again.
[->][Color:0x5]Striking enemy weaknesses to increase
the number of times you can act[Color:0x0] will be
the key to gaining the advantage in
battle.
[->]You struck a weakness with a normal
attack this time, but by gaining new
skills such as ice and electric attacks,
you can strike other weaknesses as well.
[->]Also, your actions can not only increase,
but [Color:0x5]decrease[Color:0x0] as well.
[->]When an [Color:0x5]attack misses or is nulled,[Color:0x0]
it will use more icons than normal,
decreasing your number of actions.
[->]This rule applies to the enemy's actions
as well.
[->]If the enemy strikes your weakness, [Color:0x5]it
will gain actions,[Color:0x0] while if the enemy's
attack is evaded or nulled, [Color:0x5]you can
cause the enemy to lose actions.[Color:0x0]
[->]That sums up the basic flow of battle.
Concentrate on [Color:0x5]both sides' weaknesses and
remaining Press Turns[Color:0x0] to take control of
the tide of battle.

8: (Demon) [13 1, 413204]A human... A human is here!

0: [END]
1: [71 1]You−−a human−−wish to make an ally
of me?
[->]Hahaha! Your jokes will not distract
me. Let us return to battle.
[->][END]
2: A contract?
With a human!?
Ha!
What nerve!
Begone!
[END]
3: [71 1]Is it a human custom to attack
someone before extending a greeting?
[->]How barbaric...
[->][END]
4: How rude!
You would attack us?
You humans...
Barbaric!
Disgusting.
[END]
5: [71 1]...What manner of jest is this?
[->]I would never pass up the opportunity
to kill a human.
[->][END]
6: [71 1]Now, then... I cannot become your
ally for free, of course.
[->][END]
7: A contract?
We have our price.
It's very fair...
What do you say?
We will be paid.
[END]
8: [71 1]Very well. From this point on, I am
yours to command.
[->][END]
9: Very well.
Our strength is yours.
We will serve.
Our contract...
Please take it.
[END]
10: [71 1]First, you must offer me a gift.
It is but a common courtesy.
[->][END]
11: There must be gifts.
It is only courtesy.
Let us have them.
Gifts, yes.
Give them to us.
[END]
12: [71 1]Hmm... It would seem that you cannot
take any more demons with you.
[->]Que sera, sera.
...Farewell.
[->][END]
13: [71 1]I am [Color:0x5][Demon race 1] [Demon name 1].[Color:0x0]
It is a pleasure to meet you.
[->][END]
14: [71 1]Ah... It seems that my level is
superior to yours.
[->]My apologies, but I cannot become
your ally.
[->][END]
15: [71 1]Hm? I see that one of my fellows is
accompanying you.
[->]See to it he is treated properly.
[->][END]
16: [71 1]I have an idea! Allow me to invite
other demons to join us.
[->][END]
17: [71 1]Oh... But it seems that you only have
enough room for me.
[->]I suppose I won't extend an invitation
to anyone else, then.
[->][END]
18: [71 1]I shall join you as well. I am
feeling generous at the moment.
[->][END]
19: [71 1]...Don't let it get to you.
You simply lack charisma.
[->][END]
20: [71 1]Next, I shall join you...
[->][END]
21: [71 1]Hm... It would be a shame to waste
this opportunity. I shall introduce
you as an acquaintance of mine.
[->]I have a wide network of associates
to select from.
[->][END]
22: [71 1][Demon name 2] summoned me at very
short notice. I have a very demanding
boss...
[->]...And now I must become this human's
ally? Oh, very well.
[->][END]
23: Hm!
You already have one.
Excellent taste.
Ho−ho...
Use him wisely.
[END]
24: You can trust us.
Do not hesitate.
We have power.
Feel free to use it.
Farewell.
[END]
25: [71 1]You would ask a demon for a truce?
You have such an innocent mind.
[->]...But, no matter. My mood depends
on what gifts you have to offer.
[->][END]
26: A truce?
How droll.
We'll consider it!
Of course...
You have gifts, yes?
[END]
27: [71 1]You are excused. You should be
thanking me for my clemency.
[->][END]
28: You are excused.
Begone.
Remember this.
We are merciful.
Be grateful.
[END]
29: [71 1]You would interrupt my slumber...?
Troublesome human...
[->]Leave me be...
[->][END]
30: Zzzzzz...
Zzzzzz...
Zzzzzz...
Zzzzzz...
*yawn*
[END]
31: You would wake us?
How rude...
Wastrel...
Begone!
Let us sleep...
[END]
32: [71 1]A moment, if you will.
I shall heal you.
[->]If I did not do this, a weak creature
such as you would not last very long.
[->][END]
33: One moment...
We shall heal you.
It is a mercy.
You would die soon.
Fragile human.
[END]
34: [71 1]...Sorry, but I do not have the time
to deal with humans.
[->]That is, unless you have a gift for
me.
[->][END]
35: You have a gift?
Very wise, human.
Let us have it.
Come, come.
Share.
[END]
36: [71 1]Very well... Hear my refined words,
and let us speak of enjoyable things.
[->][END]
37: Hmhmhm...!
Splendid!
Humans!
Praising me!
This ecstasy!
[END]
38: [71 1]Ah... To waste one's precious life
simply prattling away... Is this not
an extravagant pastime?
[->]Please, allow me to join you in an
idle conversation.
[->][END]
39: A gift!?
For us!?
Ahh...!
This feeling...!
What joy!
[END]
40: [71 1]Today, I am truly a master of the
art of conversation. I could talk
all night!
[->][END]
41: Hahaha!
Excellent!
Inferior human!
More!
Give me more!
[END]
42: [71 1]You would throw yourself upon the
mercy of a demon? Hmhmhm...
You are a clever man.
[->]But, first, I will have my pay.
[->][END]
43: ...Really?
You want our mercy?
Amusing.
Very well...
But we will be paid.
[END]
44: [71 1]Now, here is a demon's grandest form
of mercy. Let it seep into your body.
[->][END]
45: Allow us...
This is our mercy.
Feel its power.
Feel it...
Let it into you.
[END]
46: [71 1]Zzzzz... I would rather you not
interrupt my slumber.
[->]If you wish for mercy...
Then, here, you have it.
[->][END]
47: Zzzzzz...
Zzzzzz...
Zzzzzz...
Zzzzzz...
*yawn*
[END]
48: You would awaken us?
...To worship us?
You have our mercy.
Now, leave us.
We wish to sleep...
[END]
49: [71 1]Hmhmhm... What a splendid feeling.
Here, allow me to do it again.
[->][END]
50: Ah...
That was splendid.
It felt very fine.
Let us try again.
Hrmm...
[END]
51: [71 1]You would ask me, a demon, to invest
in a human's future?
[->]Without a five−hundred−year
business plan, I can see nothing
more foolish than this idea.
[->][END]
52: Those hands!
Those eyes!
How evil!
What is this...!?
Human, you−−!
[END]
53: [71 1]Ugh−−! Can a human blinded by greed
truly be this dangerous...!?
[->][END]
54: How terrifying!
Human...!
I see you truly now!
What horror...
Urrrgh!
[END]
55: [71 1]Did you think that wealth equates
with power? Then I shall teach you...
[->]Feel what real power is!
[->][END]
56: Insolence!
Learn your place!
I will kill you!
We will feast on you!
Now face us!
[END]
57: [71 1]Ahhhh! Stop that immediately!
[->][END]
58: Ahhhh!
Stop that!
No!
Argh!
I apologize!
[END]
59: [71 1]P−Please...! Enough of this madness...
[->][END]
60: We apologize...!
Forgive us...!
So...!
Please!
Enough...!
[END]
61: [71 1]Ugh... If this is truly happening,
then you can have my money.
[->]I would rather be destitute than
face the prospect of being forever
pestered by a human!
[->][END]
62: Forgive me...!
Take my money!
How is that?
It is enough, no?
Enough...!
[END]
63: [71 1]I said, ”Enough!” That is it, you
filthy nincompoop!
[->][END]
64: Stop!
Enough, damn you!
Are you deaf!?
Leave off!
Let us be!
[END]
65: [71 1]You would ask me for funds, after
rendering me helpless...!?
[->]I would never invest in a scheme
headed by someone like you!
[->][END]
66: I cannot move...!
How evil...!
Such treachery!
Vile human!
You will suffer!
[END]
67: [71 1]You have an interest in a demon's
belongings? Well, then, let us begin
our bargaining.
[->][END]
68: It is not ”selling.”
How boorish.
Think of this...
...as ”mutual gifting.”
Let us negotiate.
[END]
69: [71 1]Handle it with care, o greedy human.
[->][END]
70: We have a deal.
Now, then...
Take care.
You are greedy...
We are done here.
[END]
71: [71 1]You show an interest in the
belongings of demons...? Hmhmhm!
You have excellent taste!
[->]Now, take as much as you want,
o greedy human!
[->][END]
72: You show interest?
What do we have here?
Oh, very good!
Take it all, human!
You have taste!
[END]
73: [71 1]I will give you this, as well.
It seems a perfect fit for someone
as greedy as yourself.
[->][END]
74: Have this, too.
Greedy human...
This befits you.
Hmhmhm.
Yes, take it.
[END]
75: [71 1]Let us try something different for a
change. We will let money be the
deciding factor.
[->]Give me... hm... [Color:0x1][Amount 1] Macca.[Color:0x0]
What say you, human?
[->][END]
76: This is dull.
[Color:0x1]Money will decide.[Color:0x0]
Do you have enough?
[Color:0x1][Amount 1]...[Color:0x0]
What do you say?
[END]
77: [71 1]I shall take [Color:0x1][Item 1].[Color:0x0]
[->][END]
78: Offer us [Color:0x1]an item.[Color:0x0]
A [Color:0x1][Item 1].[Color:0x0]
We shall accept that.
Come, now.
We wait.
[END]
79: [71 1]I shall take [Color:0x1][Amount 1] Macca.[Color:0x0]
[->][END]
80: [Color:0x1]Macca.[Color:0x0]
Offer it to us.
We shall take it.

Give it to us.

You know what it is.
Give us [Color:0x1]that.[Color:0x0]
You understand?
We shall take it.
[END]
101: [71 1]I have a riddle for you to solve.
”What is it I want?”

102: Riddle me this...
”What do we want?”
Can you answer?
Take your time.
What is it?
[END]
103: [71 1]...Ah, excellent. I shall take it.
[->][END]
104: Splendid.
We knew you'd know.
Very well...
Now then...
We shall take it.
[END]
105: [71 1]Out of the question.
[->][END]
106: *sigh*
You failed our test.
Things seem poor.
Ah, well.
How disappointing.
[END]
107: [71 1]I find myself in the mood to strike
you on the head. It being empty, it
should make a pleasant sound.
[->][END]
108: Hmm...
Is your head hollow?
Let us strike it.
We want to hear.
May we?
[END]
109: ”Go ahead and try.”
”My head is full.”
[->][END]
110: [71 1]Then, please pardon me while I test
this theory. Do not worry, I shall
not strike you very hard.
[->][END]
111: Very will.
Just one strike.
We shall hold back.
...Each.
Worry not...
[END]
112: 〉 The demon taps [Flynn] on the head!

sound.

[Flynn] on the head!
[->]〉 The demons seem pleased by the
sound.
[->][END]
114: [71 1]Very well. I will only make one
strike, so I will make it count.
[->][END]
115: We'll try it.
One strike each.
Let us hear!
How loud is it?
Listen close!
[END]
116: 〉 The demon smashes [Flynn] on the
head!
[->]〉 The demon seems very pleased by
the sound it made.

[Flynn] on the head!
[->]〉 The demons seem very pleased by
the sound it made.
[->][END]
118: [71 1]An empty−headed fellow turning down
a chance for percussive fun?
How insolent.
[->][END]
119: Hmph...!
It was a joke!
Indeed...!
Were you serious?
Hahaha!
[END]
120: [71 1]...This should do nicely. You are
a skilled gift−giver.
[->][END]
121: I am satisfied.
This is enough.
Well done.
Indeed.
You did well.
[END]
122: [71 1]Hmhmhm... Excellent...! I've never
felt better...!
[->][END]
123: Mwahaha!
Excellent!
Very satisfied!
A great feeling!
I'm impressed!
[END]
124: [71 1]I see... That is quite interesting...
[->][END]
125: Hmmm...
That is your choice?
I see...
Now then...
What should we do?
[END]
126: [71 1]Hmhm... You would withhold it from
me? Are you mocking me?
[->]For that, you must die.
[->][END]
127: Hmhm...
So you have it...
...But won't share?
I see...
Such insolence!
[END]
128: [71 1]...We are done here. I won't ask you
again.
[->][END]
129: We are done here.
I am fed up.
*sigh*
I won't ask you...
Ever again.
[END]
130: [71 1]Hmhm... Playing coy with me?
You mock me...
[->]You may die now.
[->][END]
131: Hmhm...
Playing coy...?
Hrm...
I see...
If that is the case...
[END]
132: [71 1]You are quite a poor human...
[->][END]
133: What!?
You don't have it?
*sigh*
What to do now...
A destitute...
[END]
134: [71 1]I will not even speak with you
without a Life Stone.
[->][END]
135: We cannot talk.
You need a Life Stone.
Do not even try.
You disappoint me.
*sigh*
[END]
136: [71 1]...Very well. I do suppose that
frugality does serve a purpose
every so often.
[->][END]
137: Oh?
Are we too demanding?
Very well.
We shall be stingy.
Hmhm.
[END]
138: [71 1]Why are you dictating the course of
our negotiations? You mock me.
[->]You may now die.
[->][END]
139: Hmhm...
A mere human...
Ordering us around?
I see...
You mock us...
[END]
140: [71 1]Hahaha... How many times are you
going to refuse me?
[->]I see now. Your brashness impresses
even men.
[->][END]
141: Bah...?
You still refuse us?
It's surprising...
Still...
We are impressed.
[END]
142: [71 1]No... You are too obedient for my
tastes.
[->]Our negotiations end here.
[->][END]
143: You are hard to trust.

Stay away!
Filthy human!

Ha ha ha!
Still with demons?
It's addictive, yes?
I can relate.

We were searching, too.
This must be fate.
How delightful!
Ha ha ha!

A wise move.

No violence.

It's you again!
You don't mind?
Getting cozy...

Everything is fated, after all.

It's decided!
Battle's over...
We'll call it off!

I like it!
You're good!
Much better...

You want help...
Well, I never!
If you just asked...
We'd heal you!

a little money.

to do with it?

159: Oh my!
What a boor!
That won't do!
Get a job.
And keep it!

hangdog look on your face.
[->]Here, I'll give you this. But just
this once, all right?

161: Oh well...
Here you go!
Just this once!
It's special!
Remember that!

162: [71 1]Boy, are you so simple that you repeat
the same thing over and over?

163: Is that it?
You daft, boy?
The same stuff...
Over and over!
Simpleminded, eh?
[END]
164: [71 1]I found you, [Flynn]! Honestly,
child, you're such a handful.
[->]Did you work on being a gentleman
since the last time? Well, show me...
[->][END]
165: [71 1]...Wait right there, boy. Aren't you
being a bit of a brute, killing me
cold like this?
[->]Yes, I s'pose I am begging for my
life... What'll it take for you to
spare me?
[->][END]
166: ...Hold on.
You're killing us?
That's no good.
What should we do?
We're begging you!
[END]
167: [71 1]If that's what it takes to buy my life,
then it's a cheap price to pay.
[->][END]
168: That's good.
If that's the cost...
All right, then.
That's not so much.
A small price!
[END]
169: [71 1]So you're dead set on killing me...
All right, I understand.
[->]I'll show you how a real demon dies!
[->][END]
170: We understand!
This is it, then!
All righty!
Come get us!
We'll show you!

171: [71 1]Ah, a human! Perfect timing, boy.
[->]I have a favor to ask. How about it...?
Will you hear an old woman out?

Don't buy it

[END]
113: (Ring of Gaea woman) [7a 54][13 1, 404411]...An ordinary man like you has no right
to even approach me. Do you not know how

he would ever want to take part in
this cavalcade of psychotics.

district, this veteran Hunter
wields the power of the gods!

[->](Take−Mikazuchi) [7a 65355]I was summoned to this country in
order to save it while it was losing
a war about a hundred years ago.

spirits on their side. I was severely
injured, and the country lost the war...

out around here. It's rather dull.
[->]This land lacks a Summoner.

me...

looking for someone stronger than me.

were other demons summoned here years

future right now. We were thinking

slowly progressing towards a utopia
for us.

a utopia? Is this what equality truly
means?

is that we have brought everyone down
to the level of the former Casualries.

the day we have the power to pierce
through to the sun shining above us!

completely ground−breaking.

ones. If you can, try to find us some

be involved in this episode, gather
'round!
[END]
6: (Director) [7a 47][13 1, 403242]Well, you'd better get ready, and
quick. We're going to be starting
pretty soon.
[END]
7: 〉 A number of Hunters crowd around to
hear the Director speak.
[END]
8: (Director) [7a 47][13 1, 403221]Right, let me explain the rules.
[->]The show's named ”RedxWhite Punchdown
Smacktacular!” Team Red and Team White
are going to fight to the death.
[->]Now, I'm not asking you guys to kill
each other. We're all humans here.
[->]The humans are all on Team White, and
Team Red is all demons. So you should
be used to this sort of thing, right?
[->]The only difference is that you're
gonna be doing it on camera.
[->]Oh, and no rigging the show with your
opponent! Show our viewers the reality
of a Hunter taking down demons!
[->]...I ought to mention that in the last
episode, Team White was obliterated
almost instantly.
[->]I hope I get a better show out of
you guys this time around!
[->]Okay, cameras are rollin'.
[->]The arena for these battles will be
the streets here in east Shinjuku.
[->]We've got the streets locked down
during filming, so don't even think
of running. Fight to the bitter end!
[->]Now get out there and give us some
awesome fights to get our ratings up.
We're live in three... two... one...
[END]
9: (Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403041]Wow, that was something else!
You took on that horde of demons all
on your own!
[->]...Looks like a good portion of us
Hunters have been killed, though...
[->]Still, I'm gonna survive and get my
hands on that prize money!
[END]
10: (Hunter) [7a 69].........
[->].........
[->][13 1, 403013]...Huh!?
[->]I don't remember anything after that
demon started singing.
[->]This lady came into my dreams...
She was so beautiful...
[->]...Uh, wait. Was I in some deep shit
just now?
[->]Well, thanks for killing that demon,
then. You really saved my ass.
[END]
11: (Hunter) [7a 69][13 1, 403021]Dammit! We screwed up!
[->]That demon was so sweet and cute,
everybody underestimated her.
[->]Almost all the Hunters who fell for
her lost their lives.
[->]You managed to keep your cool, though.
[END]
12: ”Yeah.”
”Actually, I didn't.”
”I feel sorry.”
[END]
13: (Hunter) [7a 69][13 1, 403031]You're a true Hunter, buddy!
[->]Let's hunt down the rest of these
demons and get the prize!
[END]
14: (Hunter) [7a 69][13 1, 403042]I see your point. Yeah, huh.
[->]I would've liked to make that demon
my ally, too.
[END]
15: (Hunter) [7a 69][13 1, 403041]You feel sorry... for the demon?
[->]After all those Hunters she killed,
you must be something special to be
able to say that.
[->]I do think you've got a soft heart,
but there's something scary about you.
[END]
16: (Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403042]You're strong, man.
Beating that demon.
[->].........
[->]Y'know, everybody squished by that
demon all had these looks on their
faces right before they died...
[->]It was like... they were incredibly
happy, or caught in a perfect dream,
or something...
[->]Would you be willing to die, if it meant
being able to feel like that?
[END]
17: ”I would love it.”
”You'd die.”
”What the hell are you saying?”
[END]
18: (Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403031]Yeah, I think you and me are gonna
get along just fine.
[->]Still, we'd be dead. But maybe I
wanna be squished...
[END]
19: (Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403042]Yeah, huh...
[->]Still, I get the feeling like those
people figured it was a fair price
to pay for the experience.
[->]I could tell.
[END]
20: (Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403042]Y−Yeah. What was I thinking?
[->]Sorry, I was just wonderin'.
Forget I mentioned it.
[END]
21: (Hunter) [7a 69][13 1, 403002]Man, I can't believe it. You beat
most of the demons yourself.
[->]It's thanks to you that me and a couple
of the other Hunters have been able to
survive this long.
[->]We're almost there! The money is so
close I can almost taste it!

[END]
23: (Announcer) [7a 138][13 1, 406001]Sorry to keep you waiting! It's the
ultimate climax of RedxWhite Punchdown
Smacktacular XIII!
[->]The final demon, the leader of
Team Red, is a god among gods!
[->]One of the primordial goddesses,
Tiamaaaaaaat!
[END]
24: (Announcer) [7a 138][13 1, 406003]We have a winner!
[->]The champion of RedxWhite Punchdown
Smacktacular XIII is.........
[->]Team White!
The Hunters are victorious!
[END]
25: (Announcer) [7a 138][13 1, 406001]That was a heated match!
[->]It was a fight to the death! You'd
better believe we're gonna be digging
plenty of highlights from this one!
[->]Until our next Smacktacular...
So long, everyone!

26: (Director) [7a 47][13 1, 403231]Good job, good job!
[->][Flynn], buddy, you were great out
there! We should go drinking some time,
on me!
[->]It's good to see Team White win once
in a while, you know? It keeps viewer
numbers up. Great show today!
[->]Everybody else, you did great, too.
Let's all get together for a wrap
party sometime later!
[->]What? Who said that?
...I know I just heard somebody say
”Give us the prize already, asshole!”
[->][13 1, 403211]Fine, you ungrateful little shits.
I was in a good mood and everything.
[->]Here.

live, if you've got power. But if you
don't, you're gonna have a bad time.

around the city, you have to prove
yourself to the Ring of Gaea...

come to my aid in my hour of need.

your retrieving the coffin of my
husband, Osiris.

the necessary preparations for his
resurrection.

is for you to take him to the world
below.

Kingdom of Mikado where this man can
live in peace.

that a man named Fujiwara can be
trusted with such matters.

Fujiwara?

can use when gathered into hordes.
[->]Under a Samurai's command, they are
strong attacks that temporarily
summon a group of demons.
[->]These hordes can be troublesome foes,
but if you can convince one to help
you, it can be a tremendous asset.

you should be able to use one or two
Legion Skills.

”Scout” command while in conversation
with the demons.
[->]If you are successful, the horde may
”teach” you the Legion Skill.

Whisper the skill to you.

singularly, this is about the same.

Cathedral of Shadows? He's the
expert on this sort of thing.

tell you.
[->]I've lost contact with the Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado.
[->]I think it's because we've split
from them.
[->]For now, I'm going to set all Mikado−
related quests as ineligible to be
accepted.

9: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 0, 502044]Hold on, there's something I need to

again.

completed anymore.

quests now.

5: Challenge quests other than those where
you must turn in items, such as those
where you must slay certain demons, must
be accepted from the list.
[->]Select Quests from the menu screen and
then select Challenge Quest.
[END]
6: First, select the demon−slaying quest,
[Color:0x5]The Lion's Roar Within Naraku.[Color:0x0] The other
two quests are item delivery quests, so
there is no need to accept them.
[END]
7: You are now done accepting the
Challenge Quest.
[->]During Challenge Quests, normal quests will
be put on hold. If you wish to proceed with
normal quests, you are free to [Color:0x5]abandon[Color:0x0] the
current Challenge Quest at any time.
[->]Also, in regards to Challenge Quest
rewards, if you already have the maximum

10: Challenge quests other than those where
you must turn in items, such as those
where you must slay certain demons, must
be accepted from the list.
[->]These types of quests will not progress
unless they are accepted. 
[Color:0x5]Lion's roar echoing in Naraku[Color:0x0] counts as one, but it has already been accepted.
[->]During Challenge Quests, normal quests will

0: (Patrolling Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]Today is like any other peaceful day
in the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado.
No sign of conflicts or strife.
[->]There were a few of the usual skirmishes,
of course, but nothing like what a Samurai
might face elsewhere.
[END]
1: (Patrolling Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]Hail, fellow prentices. Are you growing
accustomed to being Samurai?
[->]You have proven yourselves in the
”field exercise” and the teachings of
Sir K. You have done well.
[->]Seize today to relax and make merry
like the youths you are.

[END]
3: (Patrolling Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403011]I have heard that the Monastery is
ready to formally declare the reading
of Literature to be anathema.
[->]What will I tell the people if they
ask me why? Shall I be direct and say
it turns one into a demon...?
[->]I am not certain how to answer such
a question...
[END]
4: (Patrolling Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]We've searched the people's homes while
they attended the public execution...
[->]Much Literature has been confiscated.
Though I doubt the people have given
up their passion for it...
[END]
5: (Patrolling Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]I'll tell you what I have experienced
of late, but I must preface it by
insisting that I have not gone mad.
[->]I had the honor of seeing our new
leader in a dream... Her inconceivably
warm voice encouraged me...
[->]The next day, I found that the people
had regained their peace, as if they
had been exorcised...
[END]
6: (Patrolling Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]Today is like any other peaceful day
in the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado.
No sign of conflicts or strife.
[->]Our new leaders have informed us that no
more Black Samurai shall emerge in
this kingdom.
[->]We will at last be rid of the demons
that tormented our kingdom for so long...
[END]
7: (Patrolling Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]I love my fellow subjects dearly.
But at the same time, they are the
seedbeds of the demons...
[->]Does the Samurai code compel me to
protect the roots of this evil? I felt
conflicted over my duties...
[->]But then I saw Isabeau dashing about,
desperate to pacify and listen to the
people.
[->]I understand now that I needn't
rationalize it at all. I love both
the kingdom and its people...
[END]
8: (Guiding Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403002]Hello. Are you two here for the
Gauntlet ceremony?
[->]Then you'll want to go inside Mikado
Castle and make for the Aquila Statue
Plaza.
[END]
9: (Guiding Samurai) [7a 115][13 1, 403001]Do not be fooled by my clothing.
I, too, am a Samurai.
[->]I am conducting a mission incognito,
you see. You might say I am looking
for a suspicious person...
[->]In recent days, the man has seemed to
enter and exit the castle town quite
frequently.
[->]The scuttlebutt is that the man is
providing something to the Casualries.
[->]I've been watching from this post since
morning, though. I suppose he may not
show his face today...
[END]
10: (Guiding Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403043]The Black Samurai has been sighted in
many places around Mikado.
[->]The first sightings were in Cheoda and
Setteguye, but she has been seen all
around the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado.
[->]I must say, it's hard to believe. How
can she move so quickly in so short
a time?
[END]
11: (Guiding Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403002]The Black Samurai said she would
live again...
[->]The subjects who attended the public
execution spread word of her claim far
and wide across Mikado.
[->]In some regions, they are only holding
more Sabbaths to pray for her revival!
This turn of events is alarming...
[END]
12: (Guiding Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403022]In many regions of the kingdom, those
who supported the Black Samurai or took
part in Sabbaths have disappeared.
[->]Perhaps it was God's wrath, as our
new leader would have it.
[->]People in this kingdom now fear and
respect God... it has brought down the
number of Sabbaths held dramatically.
[END]
13: (Guiding Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403002]On advice from our new leaders, we are
conducting a loyalty test in many
regions across the kingdom.
[->]We show an image of the Black Samurai
and see if a subject is willing to
trample it underfoot.
[->]This splendid idea will allow us to root
out what demon forces remain. Soon, our
kingdom shall be free from their curse.
[END]
14: (Guiding Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403001]Some of the people, upset that the new
leaders make no public appearances,
have started to hold Sabbaths again.
[->]It has forced me to think about one
thing I should have considered sooner.
Why we control the friendly demons...
[->]After all, humans and demons are but
two sides of a coin. Perhaps we should
not be separated...
[->]It may be better to attempt to live in
harmony with them. There may be one out
there testing this point...
[END]
15: (Demon) [7a 65225][13 1, 411007]I swear, the people in this country...
Are they nuts!? C'mon, look at me!
I'm a frickin' demon, y'know?
[->]But all they do when they see me is
scream and whimper God's name. They
don't even try to run!
[->]And that ain't no fun at all! The
thrill of the hunt is in the chase!
[END]
16: (Guiding Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403002]There are some who are opposed to the
idea of moving to a new land...
[->]But all it took was the mention of
your name to convince them and stop
their grumbling.
[->]It crossed my mind at such times that
God is a necessary evil to keep the
people in line... 
[END]
103: (Patrolling Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403011]Even if the Monastery wants to prohibit
Literature, once people have the taste
for it, they won't easily give it up.
[->]I hear that the people pretend to
normalcy while concealing the books.
They loan them out to one another...
[->]We are certain of it, but we haven't
proof. And I loathe myself for turning
a suspicious eye on my fellow subjects.
[END]
104: (Patrolling Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]Were I to ask any subject if he had
read Literature, he would respond:
[->]”Of course not, master Samurai, Sir!”
[->]It saddens me... The glorious people,
chosen by God to be part of our
kingdom...
[->]They have learned deceit in order to
indulge their desires...
[END]
107: (Patrolling Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]We considered bringing the pigs along
with us to Tokyo...
[->]But in the end, we had to preserve most
of them in salt and let the people
bring them that way.
[->]They made the ultimate sacrifice for us.
It reminds us how precarious our
situation is.
[->]We must not forget all that. We must
stay humble in the new world...
[END]
110: (Guiding Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403043]There were some men who had planned a
protest movement upon hearing that the
Black Samurai was to be executed.
[->]To a man, they turned out to be covert
supporters of the Black Samurai. We've
rounded them all up, naturally.
[->]But no matter how tight a grip we try
to keep on some things, word of mouth
always slips through our fingers...
[END]
203: (Patrolling Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403011]Abbot Hugo has devised a scheme to
invite the people into Mikado Castle.
[->]While they attend the public execution,
the Samurai are under orders to search
their dwellings.
[->]Abbot Hugo would have we noble Samurai
doing the work of common thieves!
It is preposterous!

in his place.

5: (Innocent man) [7a 34][13 1, 403203]I once had a son. He refused to work

I even adopted another son to do my

7: (Talkative woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403303]If you become a Blessed Samurai, you'll
be counted as a Luxuror too! What a

myself. It's the station in life God
has given me.

Are you on holiday today?

[->]Even Luxurors come down to buy the
bread there.
[END]
9: (Talkative woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403341]That bakery always smells so good.
[->]Just yesterday, I was telling a boy
from outside the village about it...
[END]
10: (Talkative woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403302]The baker seems to do a brisk business.
He even gets customers from other
villages.
[->]Until now, no one had ever considered
shopping outside their hometown...
[->]I suppose it's because of those
Sabbaths. I see a lot of people come
and go these days.
[END]
11: (Talkative woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403302]Black Samurai said that God bore us
no love...
[->]Does she mean that there is no God?
Then who assigned our roles?
[END]
12: (Talkative woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403302]Black Samurai said that God bore us
no love...
[->]But that was utter bilge. Of course
God exists!
[->]Why, our new leader called herself a
messenger from God, didn't she?
[END]
13: (Talkative woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403302]I've actually never met the new leader

She knows everything happening in
this kingdom.
[END]
14: (Talkative woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403321]I've actually never met the new leader

We blindly put our trust in someone
we'd never once met.
[END]
15: (Craftsman) [7a 35][13 1, 403242]Today's that ceremony, right? That means
there'll be a whole mob of people coming

[->]I'd best pick up the pace on my work,
shouldn't I?
[->]Ah well. I'm not paid to use my brain.
The Luxurors can do the thinking for me.
[END]
16: (Craftsman) [7a 35][13 1, 403242]I saw a group of Blessed Samurai this
morning. Were they departing on some
mission?
[->]And if they are, should I pick up the
pace on my work?
[->]Ah well. I'm not paid to use my brain.
The Luxurors can do the thinking for me.
[END]
17: (Craftsman) [7a 35][13 1, 403242]I heard tell there was an expedition to
Kiccigiorgi. Is that right?
[->]That peaceful burg is far from any
strife. Why go there?

But the Luxurors will solve it for
us, so there's no sense worrying.
[END]
18: (Craftsman) [7a 35][13 1, 403242]The Blessed Samurai are still going to

[->]Ah well. The Luxurors will tell me if
it's necessary, I suppose.

bring her the question.

your miserable life here. Choose now.
[END]
102: (Innocent man) [7a 34][13 1, 403203]They'll be letting us Casualries into
Mikado Castle today.
[->]The Monastery has summoned us all to
Obelisk Plaza this morning...
[->]They said it would be a holiday from
work, but I ask you, what is more
important in this world than work?
[END]
103: (Innocent man) [7a 34][13 1, 403213]My son is so engrossed in Sabbaths
that he's not willing to learn an
honest trade...
[->]So I've decided to take this boy into
my home. He's an orphan who lost his
parents in Cheoda to demons.
[->]According to what I've read, this sort
of thing is called ”adoption.”
[END]
106: (Innocent man) [7a 34][13 1, 403202]...I had a son... He spent his time at
Sabbaths instead of working. In the end,
he was executed...
[->]It was I who reported him to the
authorities. I was only doing my duty
to my kingdom...
[->]But don't worry about me, blessed
Samurai. As I was just telling someone
else who was concerned about me...
[->]My son never could sleep alone when he
was alive. I think I may join him to
bring him comfort...
[END]
110: (Talkative woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403302]I just overheard a rumor from a few
Luxurors...
[->]They said that the event at the castle
today is the Black Samurai's execution.
[->]But the Black Samurai is a friendly sort
who brought us books, isn't she? Why the
execution?
[END]
117: (Craftsman) [7a 35][13 1, 403242]These days, the Blessed Samurai are
dispatched all across the kingdom.

Luxurors decide...
[END]
118: (Craftsman) [7a 35][13 1, 403242]The Blessed Samurai are needed for more
expeditions than before, I suppose...

[->]Ah well, it's not for me to decide.
That's the Luxurors' job.
[END]
217: (Craftsman) [7a 35][13 1, 403242]I've never seen the town this lively

9: (Loud woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403721]My elderly maid said that when she
passes by the Casualry district...
[->]She overhears people saying the nastiest
things about we Luxurors. I believe she
must have misheard... but...
[END]
10: (Loud woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403722]The Casualries who attended the public
execution will finally see the truth...
[->]Yes, all the negativity of late stemmed
from that Black Samurai. All of it!
[->]No one can blame the Luxurors−−after
all, we are God's chosen!
[END]
11: (Loud woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403723]There'll be no Casualries nor Luxurors
any longer.
[->]I am only an ordinary subject of the
Eastern Kingdom of Mikado now. So said
our new leader to me.
[END]
12: (Slant−eyed man) [7a 40][13 1, 403601]Is this your first time in the castle
town? You're here for the Rite, aren't
you...?
[->]It's Aquila Statue Plaza where you
want to be. You can feel the kingdom's
rich history all around you there.
[END]
13: (Slant−eyed man) [7a 40][13 1, 403621]I hear that more and more of the
Casualries are becoming interested
in that Literature.
[->]I've never heard of the Monastery
encouraging the Casualries to read...
But what matter is it to me?
[END]
14: (Slant−eyed man) [7a 40][13 1, 403612]I hear that there's a growing interest
in these ”Sabbath” gatherings among
the Casualries.
[->]I've never heard of the Monastery
encouraging the Casualries to hold
convocations... Not that I care much.
[END]
15: (Slant−eyed man) [7a 40][13 1, 403621]Since those Casualries wouldn't cease
their babbling about the Sabbaths...
[->]I snuck into a Sabbath held in Corto,
disguised as a Casualry.
[->]What I heard there was a torrent of foul
talk about our kingdom! What cheek!
I must report this to the Monastery...
[END]
16: (Slant−eyed man) [7a 40][13 1, 403603]I hear that the kingdom will not require
Luxurors for the coming millennium...
[->]Then in what way can I contribute...?
I−I don't know... what can I do?
[->]I don't know how to cultivate a field
or raise a sow... I'm coming to realize
that I'm quite useless indeed...
[END]
102: (Quiet man) [7a 45][13 1, 403642]So, that Black Samurai frequented the
Casualry district, eh?
[->]No matter. So long as this stranger
doesn't disturb the peace and keeps clear
of our district, I don't mind at all.
[END]
105: (Quiet man) [7a 45][13 1, 403622]Wh−What's happening!? I−I've just seen
some sort of animal completely unknown
to me...
[->]It ate a woman...! And worse, it's
happening everywhere in town!
[->]But our God has not abandoned us! The
Blessed Samurai are here for us...!
[->]The Eastern Kingdom of Mikado is in
great peril! Y−You must save us at
once! Hurry!
[END]
109: (Loud woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403721]I hear that the Casualries will be
permitted to view the execution.
[->]In view of the Casualries' recent
misunderstandings regarding the
Luxurors...
[->]I think that this was a wise decision
on the Monastery's part. It will clear
the air between us.
[END]
110: (Loud woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403722]That Black Samurai was executed, yes?
I saw it with my own eyes.
[->]But Mikado Castle seems to be in a state
of panic... Whatever is going on...?
[END]
111: (Loud woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403743]There'll be no Casualries nor Luxurors
in this kingdom any longer.
[->]All of those still living in this land
are chosen by God. So said our new
leader to us.
[END]
114: (Slant−eyed man) [7a 40][13 1, 403612]Those Sabbath gatherings the Casualries
favored so are now banned.
[->]What did they expect? The Casualries
were not put on this earth to discuss
and debate. Their role is to work!
[END]
202: (Quiet man) [7a 45][13 1, 403642]I hear tell that the Black Samurai will
be publicly executed in the Obelisk Plaza
this day.
[->]Most of the Casualries will be in
attendance... 'Tis an unpredecented
event in our kingdom, I must say.
[END]
211: (Loud woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403743]There'll be no Casualries nor Luxurors
in this kingdom any longer.
[->]Those still living in this land are the
ones who'll make their own decisions.
So said that young Samurai girl to us.
[END]
214: (Slant−eyed man) [7a 40][13 1, 403612]I have heard that the Black Samurai gave
the Casualries the idea for the Sabbaths,
just as she did with that Literature.
[->]Do you know what the worst thing in
this world is? Evil deeds born of good
intentions.

THEY learn it?

[->]Ah well... I've more pressing concerns
than a fool who was just executed.
[END]
4: (Arrogant man) [7a 24][13 1, 403603]Just as our God is one and only...
We do not need two languages in this

once so proud to have mastered the
mystic script...
[END]
5: (Gentle woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403731]I was born a Luxuror. My unborn child

6: (Gentle woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403741]I saw a band of Samurai today near the

I'd never seen them thus before.

care a fig for the age difference...
[->]Oh... Oh, my! Did I say that out...
P−Please, forget you heard anything!
[END]
7: (Gentle woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403721]I saw a band of Samurai departing on
a mission...

Eastern Kingdom of Mikado...
[->]Alas... I did not see the dignified
gentleman with white hair among their
number...
[END]
8: (Gentle woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403722]At last, I recently had the fortune to
meet that gentleman before he departed
on another mission!

Commander Hope.
[->]I should be thankful to have got that
much out of him. He seemed to have very
pressing business that day...

God as subjects of this kingdom... I am
honored to count him as a countryman.
[END]
10: (Gentle woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403722]Master Hope has many errands all across
the kingdom each day...

'twould be this: Why did you teach me
the sensation of love...?
[END]
11: (Gentle woman) [7a 41][13 1, 403721]A Samurai woman called Isabeau was

Maybe a little bit of both?

value in your training exercises...
[END]
1: (Stern Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]The Gauntlet you gained in that Rite is

3: (Stern Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]I've decided to stay in the Eastern

Samurai have captured the Black Samurai!

5: (Stern Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403002]After the execution, the Black Samurai's

an examination of them.

6: (Stern Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403012]I heard this from a fellow who was
guarding the Black Samurai's remains...

saw a monstrous silhouette that couldn't

7: (Stern Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403043]When someone styles himself a leader,
I immediately feel a slight antipathy

future for us, I would follow them to
see it realized.
[END]
8: (Stern Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403002]Thanks to our new leaders, demons are on
the verge of being driven from this land.
[->]We Samurai had to deceive the people
about the existence of demons while we
secretly worked to exterminate them...
[->]But now I am free from the guilt that
has tormented me so long. I owe our new
leaders a sincere debt of gratitude...
[END]
9: (Stern Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]The Commander has just called an

What is this about...?
[END]
10: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403003]I cannot believe Navarre was selected
as one of the new Samurai...
[->]He hails from a house of royal attendants
and is quite well known for living a life
of decadence.
[->]I wonder if he is up to the task of
upholding the Samurai code. It'll be
hard going for us all, I suppose...
[END]
11: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403002]I've just seen Navarre. The boy was
quite upset.

no place dreaming of becoming Samurai”...
[->]It'll be hard going for us all,
I suppose...
[END]
12: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]Hoy... is everything all right? I mean
regarding Navarre.
[->]They say he's shut himself up in his
room and refuses to eat.
[->]And those who venture near tell me that
through the closed door, they can hear
him cackling like a madman...
[END]
13: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403002]I heard that Navarre was discharged
from his duties as a Samurai.
[->]Officially, his health was at fault,
and the Abbot Hugo granted him an
honorable discharge.
[->]But in truth, Navarre begged his family
to donate a sizable sum to make it
happen.
[->]Who else but the Luxurors could pull
such strings? Ugh, merely the thought
of it makes me like to vomit...
[END]
14: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403001]I have heard the news! You've done
fantastic work! Your achievement will
be recorded in the annals of history!
[->]My, my... The Gauntlet chose some truly
surprising recruits this year...
[->]Hrm. By that logic, Navarre may have
actually possessed some remarkable
hidden talent as well...
[END]
15: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403011]What was it that Black Samurai said
before she was executed? She claimed
that she'd resurrect, yes?
[->]Merely brave words from one facing the
end. The battle is won!
[END]
16: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403021]Speaking as he who served as executioner,
I can say with certainty that she was
pierced in the vitals.
[->]I felt the usual sensation of a lethal
blow and the enemy's life ebbing. I'm not
so dull as to miss an immobile target.
[->]So once again, I assure you, I took her
life. 'Twould be unthinkable for her to
rise again after that.
[END]
17: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]Our new leaders have proclaimed that we
must cast out all the unbelievers for
the sake of our kingdom.
[->]When I first heard the order, I doubted
the report of my own ears.
[->]But the new leaders are the sacred
mouthpieces of the Lord...
[->]And so I shall serve as executioner
with pride and honor. This is the role
I have been given...
[END]
18: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]Lately, my blade has been employed not
against demons, but to smite the
unbelievers...
[->]But come the dawn of the new millennium,
I shall be free of this burden.
[->]That is what drives me to serve as
executioner with pride and honor...
The Lord is with me always.
[END]
19: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403001]If Isabeau has told me true, the Eastern

But weren't we promised a new
millennium...!?
[END]
20: (Intellectual Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403041]What was that fellow's name? Jonathan?
He is a prentice of great promise.

a capable warrior, and he has a good
head about his shoulders. A true elite.
[END]
21: (Intellectual Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403041]I have heard about you. You took the top
spot in the training exercises, besting
even Jonathan.

for both good and ill...
[END]
22: (Intellectual Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403042]You're the one who returned from the
demon's Domain, yes? It is good that
you returned alive.
[->]There are countless records of Samurai
killed in Domains...
[->]It truly gladdens me to see you hale
and whole.
[END]
23: (Intellectual Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403042]King Aquila must have had his reasons
to establish the code and pass it down
to us.
[->]But Abbot Hugo dismissed it as an empty
tradition.
[->]The head of the Monastery and thus the
kingdom has insulted our first king...!
How dare he!?
[END]
24: (Intellectual Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403042]It was your tireless efforts that brought
the Black Samurai to justice at last.
[->]Hugo boasts that it was breaking the code
which led to this heroic act, justifying
his decision... But I do not accept this!
[END]
25: (Intellectual Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403042]The Black Samurai seemed to have a face
similar to Sister Gabby's. Or was it
an exact match for hers...?
[->]I examined the Black Samurai's corpse,
you know. She had the same mole below
the eye as Sister Gabby.
[->]One serves the Lord... the other defies
Him. And they share a face...?
[END]
26: (Intellectual Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403042]The Black Samurai seemed to have a face
similar to Sister Gabby's. Or was it
an exact match for hers...?
[->]I examined the Black Samurai's corpse,
you know. She had the same mole below
the eye as Sister Gabby.
[->]I know it amounts to nothing... but I
cannot abandon my suspicions toward
Sister Gabby...
[END]
27: (Intellectual Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403002]There's no ruler in this kingdom.
No king... No underhanded Luxurors...
[->]The Eastern Kingdom of Mikado has been
reborn... In God's name, we have all
come together as one.
[END]
28: (Intellectual Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403042]We've destroyed the Aquila Statue and
scraped off the writings from the
Obelisk...
[->]The true reason our people were becoming
demons was the surfeit of choice caused
by the knowledge and wisdom they found.
[->]Our duty is to protect the peace of
this kingdom. I'm sure that King Aquila
will forgive us...
[END]
29: (Intellectual Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403002]Ah... [Flynn]...! It has been so
long, my dear fellow...!
[->]Look at this... We've destroyed the
Aquila Statue on orders from our new
leaders.
[->]They said that to revere any but God
in this kingdom would be idolatry.
[->]But if we knew that the kingdom would
perish, we would not have had to
perform such a hateful deed...
[END]
30: (Smiling Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403002]So we have two Samurai from the
Casualries this year, eh?
[->]You and... Who was the other? Ah, right,
Walter from that fishing village, yes?
[END]
31: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403041]Abbot Hugo announced that the Terminal
is back in service.
[->]Now we can approach Tokyo, the country
of the Unclean Ones, without going
through Naraku.
[END]
32: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403021]I hear executions bandied about quite
often of late. I suppose Abbot Hugo is
fond of the phrase...
[->]We have ”executed” many of those who
became demons by reading Literature...
[->]Abbot Hugo told us to think of them as
”executions” rather than ”cold−blooded
murder.” If those are his wishes...
[END]
33: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403002]If the Black Samurai has resurrected...
We must start the executions anew...
[->]More of those who turn to demons must
be put to the sword...
[END]
34: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403021]I have never met the new leaders
in person...
[->]But the fact that all the demons have
disappeared from the kingdom is proof
enough of their presence...
[END]
111: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403002]I've just seen Navarre. He was smirking
for some reason...
[->]Muttering something about ”a lesson
those Casualries won't soon forget”...
[->]It'll be hard going for us all,
I suppose...
[END]
128: (Intellectual Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403011]Oh! I'm ever so glad you came!
[->]A stream of demons came from Naraku!
So many of our fellows are dead...
[->]We've destroyed the Aquila Statue and
scraped off the writings from the
Obelisk...
[->]Though we did this on orders from our
new leaders... P−Perhaps 'tis King
Aquila's curse...
[END]
129: (Intellectual Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403002]The people of the kingdom have already
departed.
[->]The Samurai have taken up the job of
escorting the people as guards, taking
them safely to a place called Shinjuku.
[->]We who remain are patrolling each
region to ensure none are left behind.
[END]
211: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403002]I've just seen Navarre headed for
Naraku... The odd thing was, he was
skipping.
[->]Muttering something about ”The Casualries
are finished!” He seemed very happy
for some reason.
[->]Perhaps he's finally found his feet as
a Samurai. In which case, I should be
cheering him on, shouldn't I?
[END]
311: (Imposing Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403002]Hoy... is everything all right? I mean
regarding Navarre.

precepts of being a Samurai.

the worst punishment you could imagine.
[END]
4: (Calm Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403002]The Commander seemed so even−tempered
at the emergency meeting. Though I know
he was upset beyond words...

display he carries more weight in
Mikado than our Commander.

5: (Calm Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403042]Hello, young heroes of the kingdom!
I bring you tidings from the Commander,
who is in the Obelisk Plaza now.
[->]You are all worthy of receiving the
Third Order of Merit. I've never
seen the Commander so pleased.
[END]
6: (Calm Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403001]Though the Black Samurai was executed,
sightings of demons throughout the
kingdom persist.
[->]Is it because of the wisdom and knowledge
she mentioned? Such unwanted gifts...!
[END]
7: (Calm Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403002]Any Samurai not assigned to recover the
mystic relics are to join the sweep
of the kingdom.
[->]All Samurai must work in harmony to
improve the kingdom's security.
[->]You recipients of the Third Order of
Merit will pursue her in Tokyo...
[->]She has nowhere to hide now. She can
resurrect all she likes, but we will
bury her again and again!
[END]
8: (Calm Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403042]We had an emergency meeting while you
were away.
[->]Abbot Hugo convened it. He announced
that the kingdom will be under new
leadership...
[->]And that Hugo will act as a mouthpiece
for the new leaders to the people.
[END]
9: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403003]Ah, hello, newcomer. How was your
first foray into Naraku? Hard, no?
[->]If you are tired, go back to barracks
and take a nap.
[END]
10: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403003]The Commander tells me you're going to
K's Tavern?
[->]Since the training exercises are
concluded, you are officially Samurai.
[END]
11: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403002]I heard from Walter that you met
someone in Naraku, yes?
[->]As you've seen, the entrance to Naraku
is guarded extremely tightly.
[->]It is hard to believe you could have
spied a girl and a boy inside...
[END]
12: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403001]If it's the bottom of Naraku you seek,
you need only keep descending...
[->]But as no one has ever reached its
bottom, there is no one to advise you
in this quest.
[->]Prepare your weapons, armor, goods,
and demons as best you can.
[END]
13: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403041]Abbot Hugo announced that the Terminal
is back in service.
[->]Now we can approach Tokyo, the country
of the Unclean Ones, without going
through Naraku.
[END]
14: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403042]I hear executions bandied about quite
often of late. I suppose Abbot Hugo is
fond of the phrase...
[->]We have ”executed” many of those who
became demons by reading Literature...
[->]Abbot Hugo told us to think of them as
”executions” rather than ”cold−blooded
murder.” If those are his wishes...
[END]
15: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403002]If the Black Samurai has resurrected...
We must start the executions anew...
[->]More of those who turn to demons must
be put to the sword...
[END]
16: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403021]I have never met the new leaders
in person...
[->]But the fact that all the demons have
disappeared from the kingdom is proof
enough of their presence...
[END]
17: (Forceful Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]You have now seen firsthand the menace
of demons.
[->]But once they are fighting at your
side, your mission to protect our
kingdom will go a bit more smoothly.
[->]To recruit demons as allies...
[->]Sometimes I'm overwhelmed by the grandeur
of King Aquila's vision. I would have
never thought of it on my own...
[END]
18: (Forceful Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403012]I heard from Isabeau that there are
some sneaks among the fellows, eh?
[->]Using the darkness of Naraku to rig
a prank... I don't know who's worse,
the demons or those scoundrels.
[END]
19: (Forceful Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]I've read in our lore that if one is
to reach the bottom of Naraku...
[->]One would face a legendary demon with
incredible might, which served as one
of King Aquila's own allies...
[END]
20: (Forceful Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403011]I spoke briefly with the Black Samurai
just before her execution...
[->]”Why did you provide the people with
Literature?” I asked. And in response...
[->]”It's what the people of the kingdom
wanted,” she said.
[END]
21: (Forceful Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403021]I spoke briefly with the Black Samurai
just before her execution...
[->]”Why did you provide the people with
Literature?” I asked. And in response...
[->]”It's what the people of the kingdom
wanted,” she said.
[END]
22: (Forceful Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403021]I dreamt that I spoke to our new
leaders...
[->]”Why did you come to our kingdom?”
I asked. And in response...
[->]”It's what the people of the kingdom
wanted,” they said.
[END]
23: (Weary Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403203]...I was in Tokyo as well. I made the
trip back to the castle town the other
day and decided to visit my nephew.
[->]He'd grown so much... I was only in
Tokyo for a day or so.
[->]Could it be that time flows differently
in Tokyo than in our kingdom? I wonder...
[END]
24: (Weary Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403203]I was supposed to be back on my original
posting in our kingdom...
[->]But thanks to that Black Samurai, I'm
bound once more for Tokyo.
[END]
25: (Weary Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403203]Hoy. You seem to share my predicament
somewhat...
[->]I've just returned from Tokyo to find
the kingdom in a shambles. It's like
a different country now...
[END]
100: (Hope) [7a 8][13 1, 400601]Abbot Hugo tells me you've successfully
entered Tokyo. Is that true?
[->]......
[->]I am sorry that I can't find any praise
to give you on your achievement...
[END]
101: (Calm Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403002]You took first place, yes? So then, you
saw the ring, I expect?
[->]When the Commander is tipsy, he always
speaks of a woman he left back in his
home village...
[->]Now, this is merely my conjecture, you
understand... But I'm certain that ring
belongs to...
[END]
104: (Calm Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403042]The monks at the Monastery mock our
Commander, saying he keeps too strictly
to the code.
[->]But the people are very frightened of
demons now. If our Commander did not
make a show of easing their fears...
[->]Then the people's sense of security and
trust in we Samurai would be shaken.
Hence his tour of the kingdom.
[->]I'm sure that if he could, the Commander
would be among the first into Tokyo to
strike down the Black Samurai...
[END]
108: (Calm Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403042]This kingdom was founded by God. But so
then why have demons come here?
[->]The question tormented me... But now
that the demons are driven out, I think
I understand the answer...
[->]Perhaps God granted us a chance to
prove ourselves by trial, believing
that we would prevail in the end.
[->]What a stern love and trust... Only our
Father could have brought them to us...
[END]
109: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403003]Was that... Walter, I think his name
was? He said he was headed down to
Naraku.
[->]He just came from his training exercises
and is already rushing back in. That
takes a certain kind of madness...
[END]
110: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403003]The Commander tells me you're going to
K's Tavern?
[->]Have you had a look at the blackboard
yet? Ah... just go and enjoy yourselves.
[END]
116: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403021]Isabeau was urging us not to rely on
the new leaders.
[->]Though they have shown us miracles upon
miracles, they remain silent when a
crisis befalls us...
[->]In the end, we must choose our own
course... I think I understand what
Isabeau was getting at.
[END]
119: (Forceful Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]...What!? You've defeated King Aquila's
own demon!?
[->]I'm happy for your safe return, and for
your incredible achievement...
[->]But when I think of how King Aquila
would take it... I simply can't cheer
the news. I'm sorry...
[END]
122: (Forceful Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403021]I had a dream... And in this dream,
I saw our new leaders unite as one...
[->]”Why did you become one?” I asked.
And in response...
[->]”It's what our Lord wished,” they said.
[END]
200: (Hope) [7a 8][13 1, 400601]I hear that some of the Black Samurai's
disciples were executed.
[->]Her dark work eroded the fabric of our
society more than we could foresee...
[->]Damn you, Black Samurai... Even in death,
you are a grave threat to our kingdom's
well−being...
[END]
208: (Calm Samurai) [7a 114][13 1, 403042]On the Commander's orders, we've alerted
the nearby villages to the situation and
brought their people to the castle.
[->]Still... abandoning the Eastern Kingdom
of Mikado and setting out for a new
land...
[->]Do you think they will take to such
an idea...?
[END]
210: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403003]The Commander tells me you're going to
K's Tavern?
[->]If you're of a mind to take on the
challenge quests, make sure you
properly register for them.
[END]
216: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403021]Abbot Hugo convened an emergency meeting
for the people gathered in Mikado Castle.
[->]We are to abandon the Eastern Kingdom
of Mikado and emigrate to Tokyo as our
new home...
[->]The abbot's final words brought tears
to my eyes...
[->]We abandon this land not out of despair,
but out of hope. The hope for us all to
finally come into our own...
[END]
222: (Forceful Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403021]I saw it in my dream... Our new leaders
gradually disappearing...
[->]”Why are you leaving us?” I asked.
And in response...
[->]”The people of this kingdom no longer
need us,” they said.
[END]
300: (Hope) [7a 8][13 1, 400601]Sister Gabby proclaimed that we are to
thoroughly investigate every region of
the kingdom...
[->]That we might sooner find the Black
Samurai and end her life.
[->]She is a soft−spoken woman, but there
is no remorse or regret in her words.
[->]She is an iron−willed lady with some
of the strongest convictions I know.
[END]
310: (Baritone Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403003]I see you're completing the challenge
quests in fine form.
[->]More of them will be added to the
blackboard as needed.
[->]When there is something new to see,
Burroughs will inform you. Let her
handle that part...
[END]
400: (Hope) [7a 8][13 1, 400601]I returned from the expedition on orders
from Abbot Hugo...
[->]Only to find King Ahazuya of Mikado
and all his servants exiled from
Mikado Castle.
[->]It was the decision of our new leaders.
They said the old order is no longer
needed...
[END]
500: (Hope) [7a 8][13 1, 400601]Hmm... So that's what happened between
Jonathan and Walter...
[->]......
[->]I left my fiancee behind when I became
a Samurai. Before I knew it, I was the
order's commander...
[->]Now, the trappings of my station prevent
me from speaking freely. I envy those
who can...
[END]
600: (Hope) [7a 8][13 1, 400601]Jonathan... [Flynn]...
[->]We Samurai will search the Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado again on the orders
of our new leaders.
[->]Our task is to hunt the Luxurors who
fled the castle, as well as all the
Black Samurai's remaining disciples.
[->]This will be the last necessary tragedy
of this kingdom. That... is what our
new leaders have told us...
[->]I will give my life, if necessary, to
carry out my mission. I shall be this
kingdom's shield. 
[->]And you shall be its sword...
I'm counting on you.
[END]
700: (Hope) [7a 8][13 1, 400601]Walter... [Flynn]...
[->]We Samurai will search the Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado again on the orders
of our new leaders.
[->]Our task is to hunt the Luxurors who
fled the castle, as well as all the
Black Samurai's remaining disciples.
[->]This will be the last necessary tragedy
of this kingdom. That... is what our
new leaders have told us...
[->]I will quell all unease in my mind...
I must dedicate myself to this kingdom
where my dearest rests in peace...
[->]I hope... that all of our choices can
lead us to finding joy in the end...
[END]
800: (Hope) [7a 8][13 1, 400604][Flynn]... No, that is too
familiar. 'Tis more proper to call you
the warrior of light now.
[->]Demon sightings have been greatly
diminished of late. We will soon stop
sending Samurai across the kingdom.
[->]True peace will at last prevail in our
Eastern Kingdom of Mikado...
[->]Perhaps I may even live to see the
Samurai disbanded...
[END]
900: (Hope) [7a 8][13 1, 400603][Flynn]...
[->]I saw you emerge from Naraku alongside
a flaxen−haired girl.
[->]It was not long after that the horde
of demons surged into our kingdom...
[->]I fear no demon. What I fear, rather,
is the terrible thought growing in my
mind...
[->]Have I... forged the worst threat to
this kingdom with my own hands...?
[END]
1000: (Hope) [7a 8][13 1, 400601][Flynn]... Yes, I've heard it all
from Isabeau...
[->]About God's chariot, and what became
of Jonathan...
[->][Flynn]... This is merely my own
opinion, but growing up means choosing
one's friends.
[->]As your life grows busier, your time to
spend with friends lessens. So you cling
to those you feel comfortable with...
[->]Rather than spend your precious idle
moments with those who do not share
your views.
[->]I may be doing a poor job of explaining
myself... I just wanted to say that you
needn't feel disappointed in yourself.
[END]

0: (Intelligent monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403602]This is the Monastery... a sacred
place where those who serve God gather...
[->]Since you are here, you must be among
we who serve the Lord. Let us help each
other dedicate ourselves to the kingdom.
[END]
1: (Intelligent monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403602]I heard that there was a skirmish
amongst the young Samurai...
[->]These things happen when one is prideful
of the power he possesses. We must be
watchful to keep to our assigned roles.
[END]
2: (Intelligent monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403641]Our role is to study the lost wisdom
and knowledge for the kingdom's sake.
[->]We have already scoured the areas of
Naraku where the code permits the
Samurai to venture...
[->]So you do Abbot Hugo a disservice by
holding a grudge. We are only playing
our parts; that is all.
[END]
3: (Intelligent monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403602]It was Sister Gabby who proposed that
we hold a public execution for the
Black Samurai.
[->]The Sabbaths caused pilgrimages of
the people from village to village...
leading to an exchange of ideas.
[->]Presumptions and hearsay will induce
fear and anxiety. This execution will
dispel it and right the people again.
[->]Small wonder Abbot Hugo calls her the
Right Hand... Her vision is all−
encompassing, as God's would be...
[END]
4: (Intelligent monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403621]The dead have resurrected!? Who would
believe such nonsense!?
[->]It was you Samurai who executed the
Black Samurai, yes?
[->]Do not make me suspect foul play
among you... I should hate to think
she had assistance in her escape...
[END]
5: (Intelligent monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403621]The dead have resurrected!? Who would
believe such nonsense!?
[->]It was you Samurai who executed the
Black Samurai, yes?
[->]Do not make me suspect foul play
among you... I should hate to think
she had assistance in her escape...
[END]
6: (Intelligent monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403622]Abbot Hugo has relayed a message from
our new leaders...
[->]So, that Black Samurai yet lives. She is
an enemy of the state who has demeaned
the people of this kingdom.
[->]My dear young Samurai, you must swiftly
end this Black Samurai's life for the
good of the kingdom!
[END]
7: (Intelligent monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403641]Abbot Hugo has relayed a message from
our new leaders...
[->]The threat of the Black Samurai is
forever passed. The kingdom's peace and
prosperity are secured...
[->]Now... let us hope that the people will
not neglect to revere God...
[END]
8: (Intelligent monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403641]Our years of research shall surely be
useful if we are to lead the people
to Tokyo.
[->]The Monastery concealed itself at first
when the new authorities arrived...
[->]But this strikes me as an ideal chance
to let the people know of our wondrous
deeds.
[END]
9: (Sharp−eyed monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403641]I saw you in the Rite yesterday. I think
congratulations are in order...
[->]Yesterday, you died as a Casualry,
and were born anew as a Samurai.
[->]You are among the Luxurors now, and as
such, it is your duty to be a leader
for the people.
[END]
10: (Sharp−eyed monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403621]There seems to be a strange trend among
the Casualries...
[->]Though those who need to be are already
aware of it. Let us wait and see what
comes of it...
[END]
11: (Sharp−eyed monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403601]Abbot Hugo is attending the all−night
meeting now, together with Commander
Hope and Sister Gabby.
[->]The matter of people turning into
demons is one of national security...
[->]We must ban these Sabbaths and destroy
demons wherever they appear. And, of
course, apprehend the Black Samurai.
[->]There are so many issues which only
Abbot Hugo can judge...
[END]
12: (Sharp−eyed monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403642]Abbot Hugo is resting himself after
the meeting with Sir Hope.
[->]According to Abbot Hugo, he plead with
Sir Hope to take command in Tokyo...
[->]But night upon night of persuasion was
futile, and Sir Hope never agreed.
[END]
13: (Sharp−eyed monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403601]Sister Gabby has gone to the Obelisk
Plaza.
[->]This new trouble is hitting us hard,
and the excitement of the execution
hasn't yet diminished...
[->]I'm sure she merely needed a bit of
fresh air.
[END]
14: (Sharp−eyed monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403621]I've not seen Sister Gabby for some
time.
[->]Usually, Abbot Hugo can be heard crying
out for her as soon as he notices her
absence...
[->]But lately, he holds his tongue, as if
he respects her. Or fears her...
[END]
15: (Sharp−eyed monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403622]Abbot Hugo is very quick on his feet.
He was utterly insistent on gathering
mystic relics until the other day...
[->]Er, no... th−that was a compliment.
He, too, is one of the kingdom's
people, chosen by God...
[->]Oh, please do not breathe a word of
this to the others at Obelisk Plaza!
Thank you...!
[END]
16: (Sharp−eyed monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403641]Abbot Hugo is very quick on his feet.
Until very recently, he held Tokyo in
such disdain...
[->]Er, no... th−that was a compliment.
He, too, is an important member of the
Eastern Kingdom of Mikado...
[->]Oh, please do not breathe a word of
this to the others at Obelisk Plaza!
Thank you...!
[END]
17: (Reserved monk) [7a 43][13 1, 403702]New Samurai are very rare. We don't see
them every year. But this year, we even
have a female recruit...
[->]She comes from a family that has given
us many excellent monks. Of course,
this is a loss for the Monastery...
[->]But I'm sure she will provide beauty and
grace to the man's world of the Samurai
order.
[END]
18: (Reserved monk) [7a 43][13 1, 403742]Isabeau was just visiting us. She
wished to pray before departing...
[->]Though she is young, she has a
laudable soul. May God be with her
wherever she goes...
[END]
19: (Reserved monk) [7a 43][13 1, 403741]Isabeau was just visiting us. She was
seeking flowers to bring to some of
the wounded fellows.
[->]Her concern for her fellows, even while
on leave, is touching... She is a very
kind−hearted girl.
[END]
20: (Reserved monk) [7a 43][13 1, 403702]According to historical documents, there
was indeed a great deal of magic in the
Unclean Ones' country. 
[->]By pursuing the Black Samurai, you will
be a living testament to that history...
[->]Considering that Abbot Hugo granted you
this opportunity, you should be grateful
to him.
[END]
21: (Reserved monk) [7a 43][13 1, 403721]The Black Samurai is from the Unclean
Ones' country... where magic exists...
[->]Do you think that this incident was
caused by the Unclean Ones' magic?
[END]
22: (Reserved monk) [7a 43][13 1, 403722]The Black Samurai is from the Unclean
Ones' country... where magic exists...
[->]Do you think that this incident was
caused by the Unclean Ones' magic?
[END]
23: (Reserved monk) [7a 43][13 1, 403721]I have heard that we are going to devote
fewer of our resources to recovering
mystic relics...
[->]Abbot Hugo will not be pleased, I'm
sure. But such are our new leaders'
orders.
[END]
24: (Reserved monk) [7a 43][13 1, 403721]By the by, I see less of Isabeau lately.
[->]I understand that she is traveling to
many places on the word of Commander
Hope.
[->]It was a shame what happened to
Navarre... And now Jonathan and Walter
are also missing.
[->]I believe that makes you the only fresh
Samurai left in this kingdom...
[END]
25: (Reserved monk) [7a 43][13 1, 403702]Isabeau was just visiting us. She seemed
somewhat happier than before.
[->]It was a shame what happened to
Navarre... And now Jonathan and Walter
are also missing.
[->]I believe that makes you and Isabeau
the only fresh Samurai left in this
kingdom...
[->]But there was nothing insincere about
the gleam in her eyes. She seemed
genuinely hopeful.
[END]
26: (Hugo) [7a 10][13 1, 400703]Damn that Black Samurai... She's been
vexing enough thus far...
[->]Oh, hello. You're cooking up something
with Gabby these days, aren't you?
[->]Do let me know if it's anything
important, won't you?
[END]
27: (Hugo) [7a 10][13 1, 400711]So you've met our new leaders, correct?
...Very well.
[->]We're very busy compiling a history of
our kingdom at the moment.
[->]Of course we will have to include the
exiled king in this history...
[->]It gives me a strange sense of nostalgia.
My thoughts turn to the Unclean Ones'
banishment 1,500 years past...
[END]
28: (Gabby) [7a 11][13 1, 400801]To wear the uniform of the Counter−
Demon Force founded to bring peace,
and instead threaten our safety...
[->]The Black Samurai is a blight upon the
prosperity of this kingdom. You must
contain her evil as quickly as you can.
[END]
29: (Gabby) [7a 11][13 1, 400801]Please mind your step on the way to
Shinjuku National Park.
[->]You must be a savior to the people,
for the kingdom's new millennium.
[END]
109: (Sharp−eyed monk) [7a 42][13 1, 403641]Only a few in the castle are aware that
there are demons within Naraku.
[->]No one would dream that there are demons
just beyond the castle wall...
[->]It is a careful decision on the
Monastery's part to keep our silence.
To let it be known would create panic...
[END]
117: (Reserved monk) [7a 43][13 1, 403702]Isabeau just came to see us. She wanted
to offer her thanks to God for her
success in the training exercises.
[->]Though she is young, she has a
laudable soul. May God be with her

4: (Hunter) [7a 99][13 1, 403012]Kiyoharu and Akira got infected by
Pluto's poison.

beating Pluto.

14: (Stiff woman) [7a 163][13 1, 403312]Sorry to break up the good mood...

you then.

Pluto into Tokyo.

look similar to one another.

a demonoid, defeated the demon in
Ichigaya and became King of Tokyo...
[->]He declared that all residents of Tokyo
must choose to become either neurishers
or demonoids.
[->]Kenji's men took all the normal humans
left in Tokyo to Ichigaya...
[->]There, we were forced to undergo
surgery. Of course, he let us choose
which operation we wanted...

5: (Male neurisher) [7a 148][13 1, 417000]If you've seen Kenji, maybe you've
seen this too...

in Tokyo, that lab will never again
see use, I'm sure...

short−sighted. Our boss chose right!

7: (Female demonoid) [7a 104][13 1, 417102]This really is Ichigaya, isn't it!? It's

chose right!

home before you get yourself killed.

[->]I'm going to Ichigaya. A king should
sit at his throne, you know?
[->]When my sis died, I craved the power
to fight... so I became a demonoid.
[->]But in the end, I realized how
important the order is... It was
a little disappointing, sure, but...
[->]Look, don't worry about this world,
okay? The King of Tokyo's got it all
under control!

there was a baby born in Kasumigaseki?

to be? A demonoid? Or a neurisher...?

himself down the line. Maybe he'll even
have a chance to stay normal...

201: (Female neurisher) [7a 147][13 1, 417103]Huh? You're from Kasumigaseki? You mean

possibly own many neurishers...

203: (Male neurisher) [7a 148][13 1, 417003]I know it was my own decision, but

Ichigaya that day...

just neurishers with some nifty toys
they found somewhere, right?

us? Geez.

opinion, but growing up means choosing
one's friends.

spend with friends lessens. So you cling
to those you feel comfortable with...

moments with those who do not share
your views.

Hunters from somewhere else?

Sky Tower? Nah, there's no way.

1: (Grimacing man) [7a 59][13 1, 403212]What...? You have access to the
Ryogoku area? So does that mean you
can get to Shinjuku?

treasure, but it's very dangerous to
stick around for long.
[->]...Though I guess it was always like
that, huh?
[END]
2: (Grimacing man) [7a 59][13 1, 403212]Even though the demons occupying here

is fool around with their stupid

He's really moving up the ranks,
isn't he?

get my hopes up.

6: (Fragile−looking man) [7a 60][13 1, 403403]There's no safe place in Tokyo. Walk
outside, and all you'll see are demons.

have the Ashura−kai to thank.

thing I hear is the Demon Lord's dead!
Or was that just my wishful thinking...

100: (Grimacing man) [7a 59][13 1, 403203]What!? You struck a bargain with the
Kelpies? So you can actually get to
Kasumigaseki...?
[->]Well, that bummer of a place used to be
a government district. You won't find
an Association or any shops there...
[->]But the Ashura−kai's keeping a tight
lid on it for some reason. It's not as
if anyone would want to go, though...
[END]
101: (Grimacing man) [7a 59][13 1, 403212]What? You can actually go to Ryogoku

Tokyo. You think...?

Lord too? I don't know much about him,
but he sounds bad...

201: (Grimacing man) [7a 59][13 1, 403212]Now we can get to the Ryogoku area...
And not only that, but the west side
of Shinjuku, too...
[->]You know, little by little, it's getting
easier to live in Tokyo.

306: (Fragile−looking man) [7a 60][13 1, 403403]The demon in Shinobazu Pond was bad,

[END]
401: (Grimacing man) [7a 59][13 1, 403212]Hey, you know about that demon that was
always meditating in Midtown?
[->]I heard someone took him out. Not that
I got any business in Midtown, but...
[->]The freer we are to get around Tokyo,
the more it feels like its old self...
You know, before the ceiling.

406: (Fragile−looking man) [7a 60][13 1, 403403]There are some nasty rumors about the
Ashura−kai going around, but we still

you? Only Mr. Tayama could have pulled
it off.

501: (Grimacing man) [7a 59][13 1, 403212]I keep hearing about demons in charge
of places around Tokyo getting snuffed
right and left.

Toyosu and the Tennozu Shelter...

money... What do you think?

That's why I love the Ashura−kai with
all my heart!
[END]
114: (Thug) [7a 121][13 1, 403042]If that rumor about the Ashura−kai is
true, I'll never get to drink their
hooch or screw their broads!
[->]Do they want me to die in this shithole
of an underground district!?
[->]Well, if that ranking shit wasn't as
exciting as it is, I woulda died in
here for real.
[->]I had my eye on that guy called
[Flynn], y'know?
[END]
201: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 46][13 1, 404311]That demon in Shibuya? It was a
National Defense Divinity controlled
by you−know−who.
[->]And this guy cleans its clock! No wonder
Mr. Tayama's taken an interest...
[END]
202: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 46][13 1, 404311]I−I heard from the boys in Shibuya that
they got demons pourin' outta Ichigaya,
one after the other!
[->]Wh−What's Mr. Tayama doing!? He ain't
given us any orders yet...!
[->]M−Maybe I oughtta switch sides... Yeah,
I'll go see what's goin' on in Shinjuku.
[END]
212: (Thug) [7a 121][13 1, 403021]Dude... Listen, man, real meat...
Ueno should get in on that shit...
[->]I'm talkin' about raisin' livestock,
of course! They do that in Shinjuku
National Park too.
[END]
301: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 46][13 1, 404311]Hey, I heard Mr. Tayama went easy
on ya.
[->]That mercy from a man who lives his life
in a world where mercy is a weakness...
It's a rare gift, capiche?
[->]That means he's put his trust in ya.
I wouldn't let him down, if ya know
what I mean.

302: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 46][13 1, 404311]I−I heard from the boys in Shibuya that

312: (Thug) [7a 121][13 1, 403021]Damn, Ueno sure is the pits. They should
start sellin' Reds here. That'd liven
up the place, no doubt.
[->]Hell, there's plenty of good spots
for it. Like that strip club or the
old Ameya−Yokocho lot.
[END]
401: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 46][13 1, 404311]I knew this day would come someday...
I feel sorry for you, I really do.
[->]'Cause you've forced Mr. Tayama to
summon his demon...
[END]
402: (Ashura−kai man) [7a 46][13 1, 404311]How come Mr. Tayama ain't given us any
orders!? Demons are pourin' out from
Ichigaya as we speak...
[->]Maybe I oughtta switch sides... Who was
that guy at the top of the rankings?
[->]Yeah, [Flynn], him! I better
sweeten him with some bribes while
I can...
[END]
412: (Thug) [7a 121][13 1, 403021]What'll it mean for me if the Ashura−kai
gets whacked...!?
[->]My whole plan to join up with them,
drink their good hooch, and shack up
with some broads will be for nothing!

your hands on that smartphone?
[->]I thought all the phones were thrown
out except for the ones the Ashura−kai
use...
[->]I didn't get mine until I'd been
delivering Reds for a year.
[END]
1: (Hunter man) [7a 119][13 1, 403002]I'm out of Reds to keep demons away.
They're getting really hard to come by
these days...

or someplace like that. They sold 'em
right on the street.
[END]
2: (Hunter man) [7a 119][13 1, 403021]The sky over Ichigaya glowed and then
a horde of demons came out...

probably not so safe, since it's right
next to Ichigaya...

3: (Hunter man) [7a 119][13 1, 403002]Did you see the scoreboard at the
Association? That overall ranking thing?

Nothing, really. It won't feed you,
I can tell you that much.

4: (Hunter man) [7a 119][13 1, 403021]Hey, champ! You know, I was actually in
the tournament too...

It's pretty hard to hack it with the
best the Association has...
[->]That's how I know you're great, champ.
[END]
5: (Hunter man) [7a 119][13 1, 403021]Hey, champ! So you beat this Demon Lord
guy, huh?
[->]That means if I want to challenge you,
I should go through the Demon Lord
first?
[->]But I'd have to summon this Demon Lord
to fight him...
[->]Hmm. Maybe I don't want to be the
champion after all...

Sky Tower coming today?
[END]
7: (Garrulous man) [7a 120][13 1, 403403]I saw a guy in some armor coming out
of the Sky Tower.

old fantasy flick about a ring...
[END]
8: (Garrulous man) [7a 120][13 1, 403403]You know, I don't see those folks in
armor coming out of the Sky Tower

demons coming from the Ichigaya area.

You... You're like an angel...!

11: (Garrulous man) [7a 120][13 1, 403403]...Oh, [Flynn]!
[->]Our shining hope from the Sky Tower!
You're like an angel sent by God...
[->]Though, uh, you earned the championship
through your own hard work. I know that
much, at least.
[END]
12: (Garrulous man) [7a 120][13 1, 403403]...Oh, [Flynn]!
[->]I saw someone in armor coming out of the
Sky Tower again! He gave the people in
town some bread as a little gift.
[->]It was real bread... I−I'd forgotten
how soft real bread was...
[END]
13: (Tough woman) [7a 66][13 1, 403323]...What!? ”Unclean one”!? Are you
talking to me, boy!?
[->]Of course, if you haven't bathed for
days, like everyone else... I said like
everyone else! Not just ME!
[END]
14: (Tough woman) [7a 66][13 1, 403323]...What!? ”Unclean one”!? What's
with you people!?
[->]That armored guy I just met called me
the same thing. How dare he!? I just
had a bath in Shinobazu Pond last night!
[END]
15: (Tough woman) [7a 66][13 1, 403312]I'm sure Hunters will protect us from
the demons...
[->]I know for sure... At least I think so...
I hope...
[END]
16: (Tough woman) [7a 66][13 1, 403302]The Hunters are fighting the good fight.
[->]We can't fight alongside them, but we
should keep our hopes up.

17: (Tough woman) [7a 66][13 1, 403302]We thought we'd lost everything
already...

you, we realize that now...
[END]
18: (Tough woman) [7a 66][13 1, 403302]We thought we'd lost everything
already...
[->]But starting now... We're going to take
back what we've lost...!
[END]
101: (Hunter man) [7a 119][13 1, 403002]I hear you can get Reds in Shibuya now.
No one tells me the details, though...
[->]Still, good to know we can get our hands
on them again if we need them.
[END]
103: (Hunter man) [7a 119][13 1, 403002]Did you see the scoreboard at the
Association? That overall ranking thing?
[->]It's way too late to sign up now. But
who was that guy in third place...?
[Flynn], was it?
[->]He's made the top three by coming up
all the way through the regular
members. Gotta admire his spirit...
[END]
107: (Garrulous man) [7a 120][13 1, 403403]I still see folks in armor coming out
of Sky Tower sometimes.

old fantasy flick about this French
saint girl...

109: (Garrulous man) [7a 120][13 1, 403403]You know, I don't see those folks in

that [Flynn] at the top of the
scoreboard?
[->]He's from the Sky Tower too. Least
that's what I hear...
[END]
113: (Tough woman) [7a 66][13 1, 403323]Did you hear some guy killed Peallaidh?

a bath without having to worry about
demons...
[END]
201: (Hunter man) [7a 119][13 1, 403002]I just overheard something... Seems
like the Ring of Gaea is getting ready
to make their move.

child of carnage shall descend from
the Firmament...
[->]I guess Tokyo will be in hot water
sometime soon, and they're using it to
their advantage to launch an attack.

the other day...

huh? Maybe that's not a good idea...
[END]
1: (Chubby man) [7a 121][13 1, 403601]Everyone's overreacting. So there's

Ashura−kai on our side! Tayama won't
let this shit slide, right?

2: (Chubby man) [7a 121][13 1, 403642]I... I don't care about any champion.
It's a dirty trick from the Association!

This is just a sideshow to keep people

wipe us all out!

4: (Chubby man) [7a 121][13 1, 403642]Mr. Fujiwara sent us Shinjuku folks
a message.
[->]He said the underground district would
be crowded today, so we should stay
home as much as possible...
[->]Tokyo must be in some serious shit.
They're putting on a flashy sideshow
to keep attention off the real problem.
[->]Something's about to happen here...
Something real damn big...
[END]
6: (Rough man) [7a 59][13 1, 404301]Mr. Tayama is a truly great man.
I mean, I'd name my kids after him,
if I had kids.

toss him a red pill and he'll go on his
way. It's that easy...
[END]
7: (Rough man) [7a 59][13 1, 404301]H−Hey, I heard there are demons in the
underground district! Someone call the
Ashura−kai quick!

into the underground districts!
Mr. Tayama said so...!

8: (Rough man) [7a 59][13 1, 404311]H−Hey, I heard there are demons in the

[Flynn] quick!

something tells me he can do something
about it!
[END]
9: (Rough man) [7a 59][13 1, 404311]Oh hey, it's [Flynn]. I hear
you're the champion, huh?
[->]Listen, there's demons inside the
underground district! I'm telling you
'cause Tayama's gone now.
[END]
10: (Rough man) [7a 59][13 1, 404301]Oh hey, it's [Flynn]. I hear
you're the champion, huh?
[->]There used to be a demon in the west
entrance of the underground district.
He took off when the Demon Lord died.
[->]Maybe he got uneasy... I'm mentioning
this to you 'cause Tayama's gone now.
[END]
12: (Ordinary woman) [7a 122][13 1, 403301]The demon in the east entrance area is
such a headache... But that demon in the
government office makes me nervous too.

and the Ashura−kai are backing us up?
[END]
13: (Ordinary woman) [7a 122][13 1, 403301]I heard from the Ashura−kai folks that
the thing in the Metropolitan Government
Office is over with.

took care of the demon for us.

the Ashura−kai? They're the best!

14: (Ordinary woman) [7a 122][13 1, 403303]I heard from the Ashura−kai folks that

tough, they're smart too.

15: (Ordinary woman) [7a 122][13 1, 403302]It's the Ring of Gaea's fault that

20: (Hunter woman) [7a 70][13 1, 403103]Do you know those Terminals? They're
the strange devices you can find here
and there around Tokyo...
[->]Just don't get too close, or the
guardian will come out. They're these
ex−mercenaries hired by the Ashura−kai.
[->]Though they have some weird nicknames,
like ”Cosplay Pro” or ”Man of Many
Voices.” Still, they're trained killers!

100: (Chubby man) [7a 121][13 1, 403601]I hear there's a little ranch in
Shinjuku National Park. I haven't seen

take care of livestock and crops.

share, but I'm too scared to leave the
underground district...
[END]
101: (Chubby man) [7a 121][13 1, 403601]Huh... the Association's up to something
strange. Some kind of tournament...

you know, this is the kind of trick
the top dogs always pull, right?
[->]A flashy sideshow to keep people's eyes
off the real problem...

106: (Rough man) [7a 59][13 1, 404301]I didn't care much about that thing
with the Corpses, but this is what I
heard from a friend of a friend...

used to be a Hunter. He was after
the Reds.

him and put a stop to it. Or so I heard.
[END]
114: (Ordinary woman) [7a 122][13 1, 403341]I heard a rumor that the guys in
Ikebukuro kicked the Ashura−kai out.

They're just asking to bring the
demons back for good that way.
[->]Us regular folks can only live in Tokyo
because of what Mr. Tayama did for us.

116: (Ordinary woman) [7a 122][13 1, 403303]It's the Ring of Gaea's fault that

quick!

120: (Hunter woman) [7a 70][13 1, 403103]I hear those Ring of Gaea guys were
in Ikebukuro.
[->]This one time, some Hunter and a Ring
of Gaea guy were staring each other
down in Shinjuku...
[->]The Ring of Gaea guy silently pulled
out his falchion and sliced off the
Hunter's arm!
[->]I thought the Ashura−kai were a bunch
of tough guys, but the Ring of Gaea is
just as dangerous...
[END]
200: (Chubby man) [7a 121][13 1, 403601]Did you hear someone snuck into Shinjuku
National Park? Must've been some
daredevil...
[->]Or maybe he was just a thief after the
meat and veggies there.
[->]But what kind of nutcase would rob the
Ashura−kai? Must have some nerve...
My hat's off to him, really.
[END]
206: (Rough man) [7a 59][13 1, 404301]I didn't care much about that thing

214: (Ordinary woman) [7a 122][13 1, 403341]Can you believe this? Those Ring of
Gaea people are talking smack about
Mr. Tayama!
[->]The Ring of Gaea is nothing but a
freaky cult! They're no match for
the good people of the Ashura−kai!
[->]How can they say those things about
Mr. Tayama!? They should shut their
filthy mouths!
[END]
220: (Hunter woman) [7a 70][13 1, 403103]Since Shinjuku is at peace now,
I thought I might go to Ikebukuro...

are in Ikebukuro now. They're as bad
as the Ashura−kai...
[END]
300: (Chubby man) [7a 121][13 1, 403601]You know, the top dogs aren't really
great men, right? They're way shadier
than us normal folks.
[->]But it's different with those guys in
the Ashura−kai. They set up a situation
where a guy like me can get his fill.
[->]That's why I respect them, you see?
[END]
306: (Rough man) [7a 59][13 1, 404311]Looks like the Ashura−kai have their
eye on the whackjob who snuck into
Shinjuku National Park.
[->]Soon, Mr. Tayama will have 'em bring
the poor bastard in...
[->]Plus his family and everyone the
bastard knows.
[END]
314: (Ordinary woman) [7a 122][13 1, 403341]I wonder what kind of man Mr. Tayama
is... He doesn't leave Roppongi often,
so I've never seen his face...
[->]The word is he graduated from some
state university and even studied
abroad...
[->]He's a real elite. He lives in a totally
different world than us...
[END]
320: (Hunter woman) [7a 70][13 1, 403122]Slowly but surely, the Ring of Gaea is
expanding their turf.
[->]Not only that, there's some new players
in town from on up above the ceiling...
[->]Things are getting messy, I guess.
Something big is about to happen,
I can feel it.
[END]
400: (Chubby man) [7a 121][13 1, 403601]The Ring of Gaea is way too preachy.
Who gives a shit about all that stuff
about who's the strongest?
[->]Tayama's no saint, but he set things
up so a guy like me can get his fill.
[->]That's why I respect the Ashura−kai,
you see?
[END]
406: (Rough man) [7a 59][13 1, 404311]Looks like the Ashura−kai have their
eye on the whackjob who snuck into
Shinjuku National Park.
[->]It wasn't just the park, either. That
crazy bastard snuck into Kasumigaseki
too...
[->]Mr. Tayama must be pretty pissed. I feel
sorry for that bastard... and anyone
related to him.
[END]
414: (Ordinary woman) [7a 122][13 1, 403341]Can you believe this!? That Yuriko
from the Ring of Gaea has launched
an attack on Ichigaya!

freaky cult! They're no match for

[->]How dare those losers take on
Mr. Tayama!?
[END]
506: (Rough man) [7a 59][13 1, 404311]Even I heard the rumor about the
underground district in Roppongi.

our streets clean. He takes out the
bad element for us regular folks...

5: (Middle−aged woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403331]The girl next to me seems a little too
excited.
[->]There's no need to get hysterical.
Whatever happens, happens, right?
[END]
6: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403221]The Ashura−kai sure are violent. But hey,
you won't hear me complaining.
[->]Everyone knows we're still alive today
thanks to their stockpiles of stuff.
[->]Plus, the electricity they generate
let us live in safety in these
underground districts...
[END]
7: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403221]Hey, have you seen that guy from the
Eastern Kingdom of Mikado?
[->]He said that the people there worship
God. If you see him again, can you
give him a message from me?
[->]”There are demons in Tokyo. Ask God
to do something about it.”
(Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403241]I hear the tournament to crown the
champion is heating up.
[->]Everyone's fighting demons... I guess
I should try and pitch in to make the
world a better place, too...
[END]
9: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403202]Did you guys see a man from the Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado there?
[->]I hear the people there worship God...
But I'd rather worship a champion over
something I can't actually see.
[->]”Champion”... Just the sound of it
is inspiring...
[END]
10: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403232]I saw a lot of unfamiliar faces in the
underground district today...
[->]When I talked to them, they said they
were from the Eastern Kingdom of
Mikado...
[->]They were marching to Kabuki−cho with
this white−haired, dignified man as
their leader...
[END]
12: (Hunter) [7a 118][13 1, 403002]I don't WANT to eat demon meat,
of course...
[->]But we've eaten all the wild birds in
the area already. We've got nothing
else left...
[END]
13: (Hunter) [7a 118][13 1, 403012]Those Jirae were living inside the
Metropolitan Government Office before
we were...
[->]I didn't want to see them kicked out
if it could be avoided... I wish there
was a peaceful way to solve it.
[END]
14: (Hunter) [7a 118][13 1, 403042]Those Jirae were living inside the
Metropolitan Government Office before
we were...
[->]I'm glad we didn't hurt them, but I
still feel bad about kicking them out.
[END]
15: (Hunter man) [7a 118][13 1, 403002]We used to joke about hunting demons
to shore up our food supply...
[->]Now look us. We're the prey...
[END]
16: (Hunter man) [7a 118][13 1, 403002]Demon meat is an important source of
food for us. We have to hunt them if
we want to survive...
[->]I'll go back to my regular job. I doubt
I'll ever be the champion, but I can
still work...
[END]
17: (Hunter man) [7a 118][13 1, 403001]The demons out there are strong, but
we've got you on our side now. I don't
see how we can lose!
[->]Let's hunt down all the demons!
[END]
18: (Hunter man) [7a 118][13 1, 403001]There are some demons left outside.
But we've got you guys! I don't see
how we can lose.
[->]Let's hunt down all the demons!
[END]
19: (Craftsman) [7a 25][13 1, 403041]These Tokyo folk are wonderful! They
fight demons without so much as any
Samurai training!
[->]Perhaps I should forge weapons for
these ”Hunters.”
[END]
20: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404301]Yo, hey! Move out the way! Don't ya
know who I am!? I'm from the Ashura−kai!
[->]Ya step to me, ya step to Mr. Tayama!
Got that!?
[END]
21: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404301]Good work on that cleanup job at the
Metropolitan Government Office. Not
bad at all, kid.
[->]I told Mr. Tayama all about it.
You oughtta thank me.
[END]
22: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404301]I heard what ya did at the Metropolitan
Governnment Office. It's no big deal,
since we got 'em outta there...
[->]I'll be passing word about it on to
Mr. Tayama. Ya oughtta thank me.
[END]
23: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404321]I saw a huge pillar of light shoot up
through the Ichigaya area...
[->]Now, I keep myself alive with demons
runnin' around, y'know? So I don't
consider myself a coward or nothin'.
[->]But when I saw that pillar of light...
For a second, I got so scared that I
thought I was gonna die...
[END]
24: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404321]Those selfish bastards at the
Association! Well, Fujiwara was
their padrone, so whaddaya expect...
[->]They found out about Mr. Tayama.
Fujiwara set it up...
[->]Looks like that wraps it up for the
Ashura−kai's reign.
[END]
25: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404321]Man, these days, everyone's all about
this ”Champion.” No one gives a rip
anymore that we're with the Ashura−kai.
[->]Though even if we did use every trick in
the book to hide it, we've basically been
swindling them for 25 years...
[->]That shriveled−up conscience of mine
has started feelin' guilty after all
these years...
[END]
26: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404321]Who were those guys that came down from
above the ceiling? Samurai, huh?
[->]Bad enough we got Hunters doggin' us.
Plus those stone−headed guys in the
city...
[->]I tell ya, the Ashura−kai got no place
in Tokyo anymore. Guess I oughtta start
hittin' the bricks for a new job.
[END]
100: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]I actually live in Atsugi... I was in
Shinjuku for some shopping that day.
[->]My friend is gone now... I'm alone...
[END]
106: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403241]I was chatting with a dude who said he
was from someplace called the Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado...
[->]According to him, this ”Mikado” place
doesn't even have electricity!
[->]I don't know where that is in Tokyo,
but it sure sounds like a rough life
over there...
[END]
114: (Hunter man) [7a 118][13 1, 403042]Not used
[END]
122: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404311]I heard what ya did in Ikebukuro.
Been busy lately, huh?
[->]Well, ya'd better keep your nose clean
in Shinjuku. And stay outta Shinjuku
National Park, ya hear?
[END]
200: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]Huh? There's a Sanctuary in Shinjuku?
[->]Well... there's a place called Harajuku
there. That's kind of a sanctuary for
teenagers craving radical new fashions.
[->]Oh? That's not the kind of sanctuary
you meant?
[END]
206: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403241]I was chatting with a dude who said he
was from someplace called the Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado...
[->]I was only half listening to him, but
the place sounds like a fertile land
with lots of greenery.
[->]If what he told me is true, I'd love
to visit this Eastern Kingdom of
Mikado someday...
[END]
222: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404311]Don't underestimate the stuff we know,
kid. You've been busy, haven't ya?
[->]Eh, Samurai boy?
[->]Well, I'm sure we'll hear more from
you in Shibuya. Just don't piss off
Mr. Tayama, ya get me?
[END]
300: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]Once I had a Hunter I met in Shinjuku
take me to Shibuya.
[->]It was fun... we had a few laughs,
a few drinks... For a little while,
I forgot all about the ceiling...
[->]But I guess I can't be that naive
anymore...
[END]
306: (Talkative man) [7a 79][13 1, 403241]Hey, I haven't seen that guy from the
Eastern Kingdom of Mikado...
[->]He told me that religion is a pretty
big thing there. I don't believe in
God, myself...
[->]But war is about to break out inside
Tokyo. If there is a God, I wish he'd
save us all.
[END]
322: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404311]Don't underestimate the stuff we know,
kid. You've been busy, haven't ya?
[->]Eh, Samurai boy?
[->]You better kiss up to Mr. Tayama,
ya hear me? It's the smartest move
ya can make in this city.
[END]
400: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]I'm originally from Atsugi. I was
shopping in Shinjuku when that ceiling
appeared...
[->]I had a friend who stayed with me.
We talked a lot about how much we
wanted to go to Roppongi...
[->]But then... that friend of mine ate
one of the red pills...
[END]
422: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404311]What's wrong, Samurai kid? Aren't ya
in the middle of a job Mr. Tayama
gave ya?
[->]Don't ya frickin' tell me you're on
your break right now.
[->]Speakin' of which... There's a good
coffee shop in Kabuki−cho where I
like to go for a break...
[END]
500: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]By the way, a little while before the
ceiling appeared, these strange−looking
people tried to talk to me.
[->]They were with some kind of religion.
They wanted to take me to Tsukiji
Hongwanji...
[END]
522: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404311]Those Ring of Gaea guys who worship
Yuriko are basically power freaks.
[->]Former pro fighters, company execs,
that kind. People who like to show off
their power.
[->]But they never think to use their power
to help other folks. It just don't
occur to 'em.
[END]
600: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]You know, not long after the ceiling
appeared, there were these guys from
the Ashura−kai...
[->]They asked me if I had any children...
I'm not even married!
[END]
622: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404311]Yuriko's one daredevil of a babe...
Ya know Mr. Tayama's got a Samurai
locked up, yeah?
[->]She sent a direct message to him through
that... what are those things called?
Gauntlets?
[->]She said, ”I'm coming for your Yamato
Reactor...” They're plannin' to steal
our generator!
[END]
700: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]The Yakuza and those cultists are about
to go to war, huh?
[->]Please... get me out of here! I don't
want to stay in Tokyo anymore! I'm
begging you, get me out of Tokyo...!
[END]
1422: (Ashura−kai thug) [7a 47][13 1, 404311]Rumor has it the guys at Florida have
gone up above the ceiling.
[->]I hear they used demons to dig through
the Sky Tower's ceiling.
[->]They even brought in a Terminal they
found somewhere.
[->]I guess one of them, the guy in charge
used to be a military dude.

By all means, let's hear it.

really turn into a demon?

some holes... Think I should try?

makes me hungryyyyy!

in Shinjuku National Park?

”chosen by God” who were inside?
[END]
1: (Far−gazing woman) [7a 62][13 1, 403312]On that day... I wish I'd stayed with

mystery! We must begin investigating
it as soon as we can!

6: (Suave man) [7a 121][13 1, 403001]I've been to Ikebukuro before. But all
the shops there were closed...

to do it in Shinjuku now. Well, time
I got back to Shibuya...

7: (Stern Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]This person is feeling unwell, so they
let us stay in this room...

nothing could be further from the truth!
[->]The people of Tokyo are merciful and
pure of heart...
[END]
8: (Quiet man) [7a 45][13 1, 403633]I didn't realize how hard it would be
to travel from the Eastern Kingdom of
Mikado to Tokyo...
[->]And that water the people of Tokyo
offered to me... I never thought that
simple water could be so refreshing...
[->]I daren't give up now... For the sake
of those unable to travel to this new
world with me...
[->]And for myself, who blindly relied on
God and performed no good works...
[END]
9: (Hunter man) [7a 118][13 1, 403001]I heard about you guys from Fujiwara...
[->]Think of Tokyo as your family home or
something. You can let it all hang
out here.
[END]
10: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]Hey, you've seen a girl, right? She
looks teenaged, wears a school
uniform...
[->]I remember... When I was sealed inside
Tokyo, I was her age...
[END]
11: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]I actually live in Atsugi... I was in
Shinjuku for some shopping that day.
[->]My friend is gone now... I'm alone...
[END]
12: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]Huh? There's a Sanctuary in Shinjuku?
[->]Well... there's a place called Harajuku
there. That's kind of a sanctuary for
teenagers craving radical new fashions.
[->]Oh? That's not the kind of sanctuary
you meant?
[END]
13: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]Once I had a Hunter I met in Shinjuku
take me to Shibuya.
[->]It was fun... we had a few laughs,
a few drinks... For a little while,
I forgot all about the ceiling...
[->]But I guess I can't be that naive
anymore...
[END]
14: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]I'm originally from Atsugi. I was
shopping in Shinjuku when that ceiling
appeared...
[->]I had a friend who stayed with me.
We talked a lot about how much we
wanted to go to Roppongi...
[->]But then... that friend of mine ate
one of the red pills...
[END]
15: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]By the way, a little while before the
ceiling appeared, these strange−looking
people tried to talk to me.

They wanted to take me to Tsukiji
Hongwanji...

17: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]The Yakuza and those cultists are about
to go to war, huh?
[->]Please... get me out of here! I don't
want to stay in Tokyo anymore! I'm
begging you, get me out of Tokyo...!
[END]
18: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]It's just like 25 years ago... demons
came to Tokyo and slaughtered so many
people...
[->]If history is about to repeat itself,
I wish the ceiling wasn't there so
we could accept God's wrath...
[END]
19: (Depressed woman) [7a 61][13 1, 403312]Someone created that ceiling...
[->]And then a champion arrived...
[->]But I'm the same as I was 25 years ago.
I haven't grown up. I still just cling
to the hope that someone will save me...

looting in the place... Why do they
have such an intense interest in it?
[END]
200: (Dilettante Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403031]Everyone has their own complaints about
life in Tokyo. But if you keep your eyes
open, you'll find plenty of fun here...
[->]Like... infiltrating Domains to search
for rare loot!
[END]
1000: (Dilettante Hunter) [7a 67][13 1, 403001]Hm? Are you from the station underground
district? So... you're targeting that
demon in the government office, huh?
[->]Well then, it's not here you want.
Go outside from the northwest gate of
the station underground district.
[->]Then go west from the west entrance
and you'll find the foyer of the
Metropolitan Government office.

to see you here.
[->]I just received an interesting tip from
a lady. She said that we can find books
at a place called Ikebukuro.
[->]That may be just the place to begin our
hunt for the Black Samurai...
[END]
1: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403041]Ah, my fellow Samurai. What a strange
coincidence. Are you here to salvage
relics as well?
[->]Rumor has it that there is some sort
of ”sanctuary” within Tokyo.
[->]Our kingdom, too, has a sanctuary...
Though I've not set foot in it for
a very long time.
[END]
2: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403041]Ah, my fellow Samurai. What a strange
coincidence. Are you here to salvage
relics as well?
[->]By the by, have you seen any of our
other fellows here? One of them came
to Shinjuku with me...
[->]Well, Tokyo is vast. I'm sure he's
looking for relics on his own
somewhere...
[END]
3: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]Demons were spreading a rumor that the
angels were mounting an attack from
above the Firmament.
[->]I've heard nothing about this. I hope
that we don't find ourselves caught in
the midst of an assault...
[END]
4: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403011]I hear that the Eastern Kingdom of
Mikado has been reborn as a land
governed by God and His angels.
[->]The kingdom as we knew it is no
more, I fear...
[END]
5: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403041]What's this? When did you become the
champion of the Hunters?
[->]My God, man... I must commend you
for your determined spirit.
[END]
6: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]Hoy! Is it true that all of our
countrymen in the kingdom are
coming here to Tokyo?
[->]Th−This is unprecedented... Why, the
immense scale of such a thing...!
[END]
7: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403042]Shinjuku and Shene Duque... Not only
those, either. There are similarities
to be found in names all over...
[->]Perhaps the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado
was built on the nostalgia of King
Aquila himself.
[END]
102: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403022]One of our fellows has been captured
by an Unclean One named Tayama...
[->]But Abbot Hugo told me to concentrate on
salvaging relics and that you would
negotiate his release.
[->]This sense of unease I feel toward Abbot
Hugo only grows stronger... Please look
after our fellow Samurai.
[END]
202: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403043]Hoy, did something happen to your band?
I saw Walter wandering alone...
[->]It seemed that he was going to K...
Kabu... Kabukucho...
[END]
302: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403043]I've just seen Walter traveling on
his own. But weren't the four of you
working as a team?
[->]Tokyo is a strange land to us. We must
help our fellow Samurai in order to
accomplish our tasks.
[END]
402: (Grumpy Samurai) [7a 29][13 1, 403043]Hm? You didn't receive the order to
report back to Mikado Castle?

Hugo only grows stronger... Nevertheless,
orders are to be obeyed.

0: (Fujiwara) [7a 18][13 1, 401301]If you want to visit the underground
part of Roppongi, head for Midtown.
[->]If you're leaving from Shinjuku, go to
the Hills building in Roppongi via
Shibuya. You know the Hills, right?
[->]The Midtown entrance is a bit north
from there.
[END]
1: (Fujiwara) [7a 18][13 1, 401302]Hmm... So your superiors turned down
our request.
[->]Well, we do appreciate that you tried.
I'm sorry if it caused you any grief
with your higher−ups.
[->]We almost died in the Eastern Kingdom
of Mikado... Let's consider it a silver
lining that we get to die in Tokyo.
[END]
2: (Fujiwara) [7a 18][13 1, 401323]Uhm... Sorry, I overreacted a little.
Kinda childish of me...
[->]Though I do consider myself still young
at heart! But putting such a burden on
young guys like you... I'm getting old.
[->]We almost died in the Eastern Kingdom
of Mikado... Let's consider it a silver
lining that we get to die in Tokyo.
[END]
3: (Fujiwara) [7a 18][13 1, 401314]A long time ago... Before the angels
kicked us out of the Eastern Kingdom
of Mikado...
[->]We didn't know how to farm the land,
so we had to find a way to survive.
[->]So we came up with a business to
deliver the water from the lake to
people's houses.
[->]Soon, we started to offer alcohol too.
That attracted more customers, and our
supply depot turned into a tavern...
[->]Skins reminded me of the old days
there...
[END]
4: (Fujiwara) [7a 18][13 1, 401311]About 20 years ago, I think, I met this
little boy at Shinjuku National Park...
[->]For some reason, the kid had a demon
summoning program on him.
[->]He said he was going to rescue his big
sis from the angels. And he swore he'd
go above the ceiling someday to do it.
[->]It was a childish idea, but it really
threw me. Go above the ceiling...? I
would never have thought of it!
[->]He was a special kid, that one...
What was his name again... Oh yeah,
I think he called himself Akira...
[END]
5: (Fujiwara) [7a 18][13 1, 401311]If the bedrock is removed, Tokyo will
see the sunlight and blue skies once
again...
[->]The moment everyone's been dreaming of
for so long is right around the corner.
[->]I have to ask you to see this through to
the very end... Please give us our Tokyo
back.
[END]
6: (Skins) [7a 19][13 1, 401402]The demon Tayama stationed in Midtown
is one of the National Defense
Divinities.

you're ready. If you're not, your face
will look even worse than mine...

7: (Skins) [7a 19][13 1, 401403]Who? Hikaru...? A young girl wearing
a school uniform?

of us have heard of anyone by that
name before...

9: (Skins) [7a 149][13 1, 401401]Back when I was still in my prime, there
was a girl I used to see often while
I was out on missions...
[->]A little girl playing with a wheel...
[->]I haven't seen her in a long time, but
I'm strangely certain that she's still
alive somewhere...
[->]Ah, sorry to bother you. I'm still
counting on you about Masakado.
[->]If you unsheathe that sword in front
of the huge rock in Ginza, you'll see
what I mean...
[END]
10: (Skins) [7a 149][13 1, 401405]If you think about it, you'll find that
human history is one selfish decision
after another.
[->]He appears in the middle of Ginza and
they team up to seal him away at
all costs...
[->]Then they learn that Tokyo is in danger
and they resurrect him because they need
his help...
[->]If I was the guardian of Tokyo, I'd have
already given up on humans.
[END]
11: (Skins) [7a 149][13 1, 401404]I never realized how delicious sake
would be when there's no worries about

I knew you were that boy from 25
years ago.
[->]...Nah, forget I said that. I'm sure
you'll be walking your own path.
[END]
12: (Hikaru) [7a 20][13 1, 401204]You guys are just as good as I thought
you'd be.

Fujiwara...
[->]And you're still safe and sound!
[END]
13: (Isabeau) [7a 5][13 1, 400302][Flynn], do you recall the manga
I was reading?
[->]Fujiwara kindly lent me the rest of
the issues that I might finish the
story.
[->]The story's ”Casualries” defeated the
”Luxurors”...
[->]And went on to create a new country.
That was the conclusion...
[->]I was startled to learn that it was
based upon true events.
[->]Man has been killing one another for
thousands of years...
[->]I wonder if we will further the sad
cycle of man's history...
[END]
14: (Hugo) [7a 10][13 1, 400704]I wonder how many wines are buried in
the vastness of Tokyo...
[->]I think I could do worse than to spend
my remaining years as a wine researcher...
[END]
15: (K) [7a 22][13 1, 405010]Since the demons are not yet eliminated,
we Samurai still have work to do.
[->]It seems I'll have to relocate K's Tavern
to Tokyo after all...
[->]First, we must adapt to the environment
there. That done, I'll go and find a
nice spot...
[END]
100: (Fujiwara) [7a 18][13 1, 401301]The Japanese Defence Agency used to be
in Midtown.
[->]If you consider the Reds to be Tokyo's
new defense system, it's almost
appropriate... But not really.
[->]If Tayama picked that spot out of some
kind of poetic justice, he's got a
weird sense of humor.
[END]
103: (Fujiwara) [7a 18][13 1, 401314]Doesn't the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado
have anything like our Associaton?
[->]When we lived in Mikado, we didn't have
anything to do for fun. So we came up
with a hobby... gambling.
[->]At the tavern, we'd place bets on
drinking contests.
[->]Whoever won got a prize. Soon, we
started keeping a ranking board to
keep track of past challenges...
[->]Frankly, this Association here has its
origins in that game. You might call it
a reverse import.
[END]
106: (Skins) [7a 19][13 1, 401402]So you beat Tenkai...
[->]Tenkai was a god sworn to defend his
nation... And you Samurai are trained
to uphold your country's peace...
[->]Both of you are patriots, but there
you were, crossing swords to do what's
right. Pretty ironic...
[END]
109: (Skins) [7a 149][13 1, 401401]Back when I was still in my prime, there

[END]
112: (Hikaru) [7a 20][13 1, 401204]I had my eyes on you for a long time,
you know?
[->]Even before you were born. Our meeting
was... fated.
[->]The question is... if I said that with
a straight face, would you be glad?
Ahahaha!
[END]
200: (Fujiwara) [7a 18][13 1, 401301]About that idea of telling your
superiors about us...
[->]I know it'll be a tough job, convincing
those guys of our idea.
[->]But we're giving you people some very
valuable information.
[->]I'm counting on their... generous spirit
to repay that kindness.
[END]
206: (Skins) [7a 19][13 1, 401402]Tayama controls the National Defense
Divinities.
[->]As enemies, they're terrible opponents.
But as allies...
[->]...Forget I said anything. I'm too old
to be dreaming impossible dreams...
[END]
212: (Hikaru) [7a 20][13 1, 401204]I've got something important to go do...
So this might be our last meeting.
[->]But if you keep me in your heart,
we'll see each other again...

a straight face, would you be glad?
Ahahaha!

[->]Of course, the future is still very
uncertain. But at least we have hope...

9: (Bookworm) [7a 59][13 1, 403232]The demons are no more. I guess our
excuse to waste time underground has

humans into demons, so he was trying

anyway... Oh well. Point is, I don't
have to worry about demon attacks now!

favorably on those in Tokyo who rely
on your strength for their survival.
[->]If you are drunk on the praise of
such people, then I suggest you
clear your head, and soon.

reborn!

doing so does not deny our beliefs.

God...

the dogs of Tokyo will strike upon

strength that I have been training
for all this time...

Am I really in Tokyo right now...?
[->]There isn't a single Ashura−kai

openly badmouthing Tayama...
[->]Most of all, to think that humans
and demons are living together in
the same space...

15: (Hunter man) [7a 67][13 1, 403002]...The Ring of Gaea guys are saying

17: (Hunter man) [7a 67][13 1, 403012]It seems the Ring of Gaea is looking

tough about it. Are they really
humans like us?

18: (Hunter man) [7a 67][13 1, 403012]I got called over by the Association's

[END]
19: (Hunter man) [7a 67][13 1, 403002]Each city's Association must've made

Yuriko, though...

24: (Confident woman) [7a 80][13 1, 404431]I've thought back on Lady Yuriko's
beauty, and I've reached a conclusion.

world, but any man can be controlled
by a woman. That is the real power.

Yuriko. Hahaha! Go on, then, and
she will destroy you utterly.

204: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 51][13 1, 404302]It is an impossibility, but even if

Hurry and meet with her.
[END]
304: (Ring of Gaea member) [7a 51][13 1, 404302]The one who gained the power of the
Demon Lord is a fellow member... He
is the foretold ”child of carnage.”

belief that only the strong should
rule is correct.
[->]Even if Tokyo were to be taken over
by demons, I will survive!

everyone was the same, right?

Kingdom of Mikado who dug Naraku.

mystic relics can be. I myself have oft
made use of it when my purse was light.

would keep us safe!

they? I'll grant you that everyone has

in the west of the kingdom...

this? We will be safe, no...?

17: (Frugal woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403312]I'm dreadfully glad that the Black

They always have our interests at heart,
bless them...!

18: (Frugal woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403312]I can't abide those Luxurors. To think

until our dying day!

coax us to, even if it means discarding
all of that...

Are they nuts!? C'mon, look at me!
I'm a frickin' demon, y'know?
[->]But all they do when they see me is
scream and whimper God's name. They
don't even try to run!
[->]And that ain't no fun at all! The
thrill of the hunt is in the chase!
[END]
22: (Guiding Samurai) [7a 117][13 1, 403002]There are some who are opposed to the
idea of moving to a new land...
[->]But all it took was the mention of
your name to convince them and stop
their grumbling.

God is a necessary evil to keep the
people in line... 
[END]
23: (Patrolling Samurai) [7a 116][13 1, 403042]We considered bringing the pigs along
with us to Tokyo...
[->]But in the end, we had to preserve most
of them in salt and let the people
bring them that way.
[->]They made the ultimate sacrifice for us.
It reminds us how precarious our
situation is.
[->]We must not forget all that. We must
stay humble in the new world...
[END]
102: (Simple man) [7a 34][13 1, 403222]The Monastery has forbidden us to read
books. They say it is to prevent them
from hindering our work.
[->]But if they are no hindrance, then I
must assume it's fine. I see no need
to stop reading books.
[->]If they mean to forbid something, they
should look to those layabout Luxurors
first...
[END]
103: (Simple man) [7a 34][13 1, 403222]Ah, dear me... This ”Paradise Lost”
I got from the Black Samurai is too
fascinating!
[->]It's about a fallen angel, cast out from
Paradise for choosing freedom over
serving his creator.
[->]I never considered the idea that my life
might belong to me. No one ever suggested
anything like it all this time...
[END]
108: (Reeking man) [7a 35][13 1, 403032]...Hoy, I remember you. Look what a fine
man you've become.
[->]Say, that young lad who was with you...
I saw him this morning.
[->]Bound for Lake Mikado, it looked like.
[END]
109: (Reeking man) [7a 35][13 1, 403032]Kiccigiorgi's in a terrible state...
[->]The whole village and the parts around
it are quarantined. All the folk there
were uprooted to nearby villages...
[->]The Monastery said there was a wildfire
out that way, but this seems too extreme
for that to be true.
[END]
116: (Frugal woman) [7a 36][13 1, 403302]That rare disease which turns people to
demons is becoming less rare. It seems
to have had its start in Kiccigiorgi.
[->]I hear that's why the Monastery made
the decision to burn the village down.
[->]E−Erm, our home will be safe, no? I mean,
the Luxurors are working at it, surely?
[END]
202: (Simple man) [7a 34][13 1, 403222]There was a message from the Monastery.
It seems there's to be a gathering at
the castle today.
[->]And just as my mystery novel was
becoming exciting...
[->]But it'll make trouble for me if I don't
go. I suppose I can show my face there
and then slip out quietly.
[END]
209: (Reeking man) [7a 35][13 1, 403032]Looks like a festival today. Isn't that
a bit cheeky at a time like this?

don't have roofs over their heads...

to give her up to be raised by them.

escaped Ikebukuro and reached the
temple of the Ring of Gaea.

crush the Ashura−kai, she has been
given a chance for revenge...

do the Ashura−kai's bidding and
keep underground are the same.

Reactor will be left poorly guarded,
and the Ring of Gaea will take it...

Tayama's demons, and won't throw
themselves into an all−out attack.

them out whenever you feel like it.
[END]
946: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 0, 502041]All right, I'll skip the explanation.
[->][13 0, 502042]I'll register a few of them to the
Challenge Quest list. Try them out

quest you can do in VR!

0: (K) [13 1, 405000]Ol' K's the one with a lesson to teach
today.
[->]First, have a look at the blackboard
behind the bar.
[END]
1: (K) [13 1, 405010]Eh? Where did the name ”K” originate?
Why, it's simply the order of things.
[->]The first bartender was A, the next
was B, then C... After these many
years, I, the current barman, am K.
[->]I'm not sure exactly how many cycles
have passed. It simply goes to show
you how long our history is.
[END]
2: (K) [13 1, 405000]It looks to me like you were the sole
winner of that ”contest.”
[->]Talking of which, where are Walter and
Navarre? The contest's over, but they're
still in Naraku...?
[END]
3: (K) [13 1, 405010]So, I heard that you ran afoul of a
demon's Domain?
[->]Whenever I hear that word ”Domain,”
I feel my arm and eye throb...
[->]No, it's something that happened long
ago. Before you were born, I'd wager.
[END]
4: (K) [13 1, 405010]That Hugo was once a Samurai too. Though
he was more effective with his brush
than his sword...
[->]He persuaded the king with his grand
righteousness and won the people's
support by claiming it was all for them.
[->]You see, he foresaw the people's response
and fixed it so that any who rejected
his ideals was branded an evildoer.
[->]...Too clever by half, if you ask me.
[END]
5: (K) [13 1, 405010]Hope's been coming by a lot lately.
He's been grumbling, that one...
[->]They can slay the people who've become
demons, but they can't prevent it from
happening to more of our kinsmen.
[->]Hugo's public execution is nothing more
than pageantry to turn the public eye
away from the true problem...
[->]But I don't mind temporary measures,
as long as they can stem the tide
of demons.
[END]
6: (K) [13 1, 405010][最近/さいきん] ホープがよく[顔/かお]だしてくれるんだ

…それは[期待/きたい]してるんだ
[END]
7: (K) [13 1, 405010]Gabby's one of the Monastery's most
senior members. Nobody knows much
about her past, though.
[->]I recall asking her out to breakfast
when I was an active Samurai. I didn't
stand a chance, naturally.
[->]She's lost none of her beauty in the
years since... which is a bit eerie,
in truth. How old must she be now?
[END]
8: (K) [13 1, 405010]You'll find if you talk to the men in
the castle and the castle town, most of
them will speak of the new leaders.
[->]It may sound hard to credit, but everyone
had the same dream that night.
[->]I was no exception...
[END]
9: (K) [13 1, 405020]Speaking personally, I don't think that
those who are given power should act
selfishly.
[->]It tends to make the lives of those
around them miserable.
[->]You have power, too, ever since you
became a Samurai. Who will you use your
power on behalf of?
[END]
10: (K) [13 1, 405010]Hoy, Jonathan, [Flynn].
[->]I heard that the new leaders have
appointed you two to slay the Black
Samurai.
[->]It wasn't so long ago that you prentices
couldn't even use the blackboard...
And look at you now!
[->]I warn you, though. Your opponent is
a dreadfully clever woman who has
eluded our grasp at every turn.
[->]She'll be a handful, that one.
Go cautiously, all right?
[END]
11: (K) [13 1, 405020]We all had the same dream on the same
night again. A dream of a new millennium
brought about by the warrior of light.
[->]But the man who appeared in that dream
as a candidate to martyr himself to
become God's chariot...
[->]Perhaps I saw wrongly, but he seemed
to resemble Jonathan...
[END]
12: (K) [13 1, 405010]About what Isabeau said... How we're
all to live in Tokyo now...
[->]The irony may be that this is ultimately
thanks to the Literature the Black
Samurai brought, and our new leaders.
[->]If all our kingdom's people were alive
and well, this would be a futile
endeavor.
[->]It reminds me of the talk about how only
”God's chosen” can be saved. I don't
credit it... but I can't deny it.
[END]
13: (Prudent Samurai) [13 1, 403001]K was originally the Samurai's Commander.
His arm and eye were lost in honorable
combat...
[->]Even Sir Hope, our present Commander,
pales in comparison.
[END]
14: (Prudent Samurai) [13 1, 403001]This talk of more demons seen in Naraku
has in truth been cropping up for
some months.
[->]And now, a demon emerges who is capable
of erecting a Domain... I hope this
does not bode ill...
[END]
15: (Prudent Samurai) [13 1, 403001]I don't think that any have been awarded
the Third Order of Merit since K was an
active Samurai.
[->]With all the melancholy news of late,
your heroism is quite inspiring.
[END]
16: (Prudent Samurai) [13 1, 403001]I don't think that any have been awarded
the Third Order of Merit since K was an
active Samurai.
[->]With all the melancholy news of late,
your heroism is quite inspiring.
[END]
17: (Prudent Samurai) [13 1, 403001]Shene Duque is holy ground. It's said
to be the site in this kingdom closest
to God.
[->]Perhaps that's the reason that demons
have never been seen in Shene Duque.
[END]
18: (思慮深いサムライ) [13 1, 403001][新/あたら]しい[指導者/しどうしゃ]は[相変/あいか]わらず[正体不明/しょうたいふめい]

[->][東/ひがし]のミカド[国/こく]は
この[先/さき]どうなってしまうのだろう…
[END]
19: (Prudent Samurai) [13 1, 403001]Thinking on it, the Eastern Kingdom of
Mikado and Tokyo were both distorted
in their own way.
[->]If that distortion is corrected, it
should be a thing to be welcomed.
[->]...Even if it means the end of our
home country.
[END]
20: (Talkative Samurai) [13 1, 403042]There is a clear divide between the
loud ones and the quiet ones in this
year's crop of prentices.
[->]Every time Walter and Navarre come
around, they say anything that pops
into their heads.
[->]Whereas Jonathan and Isabeau are oddly
quiet, it seems. I feel almost ashamed
to engage them in idle conversation.
[->]And then there's yourself, who is nearly
silent. I can't recall the last time I
met anyone who said so little.
[END]
21: (Talkative Samurai) [13 1, 403001]...Ho there, prentice.
[->]I... I am not daunted by the Black
Samurai. 'Tis just that she... is
a lady...
[->]A scoundrel who has wronged our kingdom
she may be, but my blade was not meant
to be wielded against the fairer sex.
[END]
22: (Talkative Samurai) [13 1, 403002]Ho there, prentice. I heard that you
have the Black Samurai in hand. Everyone
in the castle town is aquiver about it!
[->]Though your names haven't been spoken.
I suppose that is how the Monastery
does things...
[->]But I know quite well the names of
our kingdom's heroes.
[END]
23: (Talkative Samurai) [13 1, 403001]Sister Gabby has given the order to keep
the Black Samurai's resurrection a grave
secret.
[->]S−Still, I believe the people should
be told...
[->]This is a dire situation that requires
caution on the part of the people. I see
no reason to hide this from them.
[END]
24: (Talkative Samurai) [13 1, 403042]Ho there, prentice... Ah, but my
mistake. You're no prentice, not now.
Are you alone today?
[->]Jonathan's gone to the entrance of
Naraku and Walter, it seems, has
retired to the barracks.
[->]Well, you've spent enough time on the
same missions thus far. Take some time
for yourself once in a while.
[END]
25: (Talkative Samurai) [13 1, 403001]Ah, [Flynn]. Our new leaders
speak very highly of you.
[->]Not only did you give the new Terminal
its name, you've become a blessed
warrior of light.
[->]You've uttelry overshadowed me. As a
fellow Samurai, it's quite vexing...
Yet I'm not entirely unhappy.
[END]
26: (Talkative Samurai) [13 1, 403001]Ah, it's you, [Flynn].
Was what Isabeau said true...?
[->]But you named the new Terminal...
You two were awarded the Third Order
of Merit together...
[->]Very well, I'll believe you. Who am I
to doubt the words of my proud fellows?
[END]
27: (Old−looking Samurai) [13 1, 403001]Hoy, prentice. Let me give you a little
advice as a Master.
[->]”Don't get upset at everything the
Monastery does.” You'll see what I
mean by that in time...
[END]
28: (Old−looking Samurai) [13 1, 403002]Until now, the Samurai mostly came to
us from the ranks of the Luxurors.
[->]I'm not condoning what Navarre and his
cronies did... but they probably didn't
understand.
[->]This may have been their first time
coming into contact with Casualries,
after all.
[END]
29: (Old−looking Samurai) [13 1, 403002]That young lady next to Hugo at the
emergency meeting... Gabby, yes?
[->]I've heard of her before, but this is
the first I've seen of her in person.
[->]If Hugo keeps her close by, she must
be able indeed.
[END]
30: (Old−looking Samurai) [13 1, 403002]Sister Gabby's administration is nothing
short of miraculous.
[->]In such a short time, she made the
arrangements for such a large gathering
all on her own.
[->]Everything seems to fall perfectly into
place for her. It's as if she knew this
would happen from the start.
[END]
31: (Old−looking Samurai) [13 1, 403002]I won't be enjoying any drinks here
for much longer.
[->]They're sending Samurai out to each
region in a thorough hunt for the
Black Samurai.
[->]I'm to head up the search in Cebouia.
[END]
32: (Old−looking Samurai) [13 1, 403002]I was stationed in Cebouia to search
for the Black Samurai...
[->]But the villagers who had turned to
demons cut off our means of escape.
And then...
[->]A ray of light descended from the night
sky, followed by a deafening roar...
I'm ashamed to say I lost consciousness.
[->]When I awoke, I trembled at the sight
before me. Every last one of the demons
had disappeared.
[END]
33: (Old−looking Samurai) [13 1, 403002]The Eastern Kingdom of Mikado will return
to the olden days wherein the people and
angels joined hands to praise God.
[->]Seeing God's chariot with you is all
the proof that I require.
[END]
34: (Brotherly Samurai) [13 1, 403042]He is quite warmhearted now, but when
Mr. K was one of us... H−He was a terror
to behold.
[->]If he spotted any errors in our kit,
we would face his dreadful fists, 
excuses be damned...
[->]I can laugh about it now, but then...
I thought that Mr. K was more of a demon
than the actual beasts we hunted.
[END]
35: (Brotherly Samurai) [13 1, 403042]I saw myself the eastern skies turn
bluish−white... the bloodied people
collapsed upon the ground.
[->]It seems they intended to reach Mikado
Castle from another village, yet they
used all their strength at the gates.
[->]Those merciless wounds could not have
been dealt by humans. And some say there
are demons who can erect Domains afoot...
[->]I believe that the Commander decided on
his sudden departure in order to confirm
these recent rumors.
[END]
36: (Brotherly Samurai) [13 1, 403042]The Black Samurai has been apprehended.
This ought to be a time to raise a glass
in celebration...
[->]But K there seems to have a cloud over
his brow.
[END]
37: (Brotherly Samurai) [13 1, 403042]I've seen our Commander speaking directly
to Sister Gabby often of late.
[->]Given Hugo's penchant for self−
aggrandizement, I thought he would be
furious to be so upstaged...
[->]But on the contrary, 'twould seem he's
not exchanged words with Sister Gabby
at all.
[END]
38: (Brotherly Samurai) [13 1, 403202]Is something wrong with Isabeau? I saw
her standing alone at Obelisk Plaza.
[->]Don't tell me that romance is blossoming
amongst the Samurai... Honestly, don't.
I don't want to think about it...
[->]Then again, we owe it to our new leaders
that we can discuss such things now.
[END]
39: (Brotherly Samurai) [13 1, 403202]Is something wrong with Isabeau? I saw
her standing alone at Obelisk Plaza.
[->]Don't tell me that romance is blossoming
amongst the Samurai... Honestly, don't.
I don't want to think about it...
[->]Then again, we owe it to our new leaders
that we can discuss such things now.

41: (Armored Samurai) [13 1, 403002]The Monastery seems to have existed 
before the kingdom's founding, but that
is not true of our order.
[->]King Aquila established the Samurai
personally. You should be honored to
be counted among them.

43: (Armored Samurai) [13 1, 403042]I'm a Samurai, chosen by the Gauntlet!
[->]How dare the Monastery treat me as
a pawn!? They could not rid the world
of even a single demon...!
[END]
44: (Armored Samurai) [13 1, 403042]I'm a Samurai, chosen by the Gauntlet!

[END]
45: (Armored Samurai) [13 1, 403042]Dammit... How can I pass up a drink
at such a time?
[->]Everything has changed. This is no longer
the kingdom I know!
[END]
46: (Armored Samurai) [13 1, 403042]Tensions have been at a fever pitch
between the Ashura−kai and Ring of Gaea,
the two main factions in Tokyo.
[->]The conflict seems to be on the verge
of boiling over...
[END]
47: (Armored Samurai) [13 1, 403042]They were recruiting for an urgent
mission before the Black Samurai was
slain...
[->]I nominated myself, but the Commander
chose Jonathan instead.
[->]Well, I can't fault his decision.
Jonathan is a particularly distinguished
member of our order, after all.
[END]
48: (Armored Samurai) [13 1, 403042]Our kingdom has God's chariot and the
warrior of light! How could we possibly
fall before the vile demons?
[->]Some of us here have begun celebrating
a trifle early. You should hurry to play
out your role...
[->]It won't be a celebration without you,
after all. Make sure to prepare some
tasteful remarks, yes?
[END]
49: (Isabeau) ...If only both wishes could come true.
That is a path I'd gladly walk...
[->]But such thoughts are naive. The world
is spun through our choices and
decisions.
[->]What kind of world will we weave...?

[END]
102: (K) [13 1, 405010]Did I hear right that you and Walter
were ”taught a lesson” by the Masters?
[->]There was constant squabbling in my
day as well, but to think they'd band
together as a group to trick you...
[->]Well, it wouldn't have been done in
my day. I can't understand what the
young ones were thinking.
[END]
103: (K) [13 1, 405010]...The situation seems quite serious.
I heard from Hope about the ”Black
Samurai.”
[->]She has a Gauntlet and uses demons, eh?
In this kingdom, only Samurai are known
for those things...
[->]In which case, the Eastern Kingdom of
Mikado must have run afoul of a foreign
country.
[END]
104: (K) [13 1, 405022]...Take a look at the blackboard.
Hugo's added more official business.
[->]Hope will be leading the extermination
of demons in the various regions. That
much, at least, is a relief...
[->]But there's no denying that our kingdom
faces a crisis. He must have a deep and
abiding love for ”mystic relics”...
[END]
110: (K) [13 1, 405010]Hoy, Walter, [Flynn].
[->]I can tell simply by looking at your
faces that you're up to something.
[->]Let me give you a piece of advice as a
master Samurai. Don't do anything that
would be harmful to the kingdom.
[->]Then again, there is a bit in the
Samurai code about, ”If you commit to
a thing, see it through to the end.”
[->]I wonder which would apply in a case
such as this. I don't know... I suppose
it's for you to decide.
[END]
111: (K) [13 1, 405020]I've noticed a decline in customers
today. Is it because of the commotion
outside?
[->]I think I can more or less imagine
what's going on...
[->]A Samurai founded this kingdom, and it
will be a Samurai who draws the curtains
on it, eh...?
[->]Let me put on a brave face this once
and say that I had a feeling this day
would eventually come...
[->]And if it has, then I am thankful to
see it happen in my lifetime.
[END]
124: (Talkative Samurai) [13 1, 403042]Ah, Jonathan. And [Flynn] too.
[->]I always see you two together. You should
value your friends when you're young.
[->]It's good to have someone you can share
memories with...
[->]If you come to that realization late
in life, after they're gone... you'll
end up a sad old man like me.
[END]
129: (Old−looking Samurai) [13 1, 403002]The true seeker of the Terminal and
that ”Counter−Demon Force” base...
[->]Seems it was Gabby, not Hugo. Though
I believe Hugo was the one to give
the order...
[->]That Gabby woman is quite canny for
one so young.
[END]
148: (Armored Samurai) [13 1, 403002]If the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado is not
long for this world, then this next
quest will be our last.
[->]Our task is to escort the people to the
new land. This would appear to also be
our most overwhelming endeavor...
[END]
224: (Talkative Samurai) [13 1, 403042]Ho there, Walter. And [Flynn] too.
[->]I always see you two together. You should

1042: (Armored Samurai) [13 1, 403012]I'm sure that wretched monk will be present at
the emergency meeting as well. I am less
than eager to be in his presence...
[->]Ah, but never mind me. I'll go once I've
drunk this. You were called by the
Commander, no? You should go to him.

0: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403001]I don't know when it happened, but
there's a weird tower in Shinjuku
National Park now.
[->]Though it seems like an Ashura−kai
project, so I'd better not go sticking
my nose in.
[END]
1: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403001]A long while ago, there was a rumor
going around that some big−time demons
went at it near Shinjuku National Park.
[->]I think it was after then that I started
seeing that weird tower.

2: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403041]Oh, so you know Fujiwara...
[->]He's a nice guy, but don't let it fool
you−−he's sharp, too.
[->]He used to be a newspaper reporter.
I've heard he knows all about Tayama's
secrets, too.
[->]Fujiwara won't openly defy Tayama, which
is why Tayama won't do anything about
Fujiwara...
[->]But I bet Fujiwara's the only man left
in Tokyo who could shut that Tayama up.
[END]
3: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403001]The Hunters who answered Fujiwara's call
are fighting the demons around Shinjuku
in shifts.
[->]But demons are pouring endlessly out
of Ichigaya... If we don't deal with the
root of this, it'll wring us dry.

Government Office was a bigger job
than it seemed.
[->]I heard the Hunters they sent there
ran away?
[->]I bet the Ashura−kai will be after those
idiots now, since the Hunters ruined
their reputation.
[END]
6: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]...I heard about what happened with the
thing at the government office. What a
debacle, huh?
[->]It's not public yet, but the Hunters
know. You fought someone in the
Ashura−kai, right?
[->]Yeah, they'll get physical if things
don't go their way. Though I guess they
tried it with the wrong people this time.
[END]
7: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]I've carried Reds to Shinjuku National
Park for the Ashura−kai before.
[->]I know there are a bunch of demons in
Tokyo that Tayama deals with...
[->]But that package had a shit−ton of Reds.
Whoever they're going to must be getting
the VIP treatment.
[END]
8: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]I've carried Reds to Shinjuku National
Park for the Ashura−kai before.
[->]I brought them all the way from Midtown
to Shinjuku. And that was a couple
hundred boxes, too!
[END]
9: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]Actually, there was a tournament to
determine the champion Hunter back when
the Association first got started.
[->]But in the end, they never crowned one,
and it got split into different
categories like it is now.
[END]
10: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]It's been 20 or so years since the
Association was founded, and at last,
we have a champion.
[->]We lost Tokyo's guardian because of that
wrath−of−God business, but now we have
a new star of hope...
[END]
11: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]It's been 20 or so years since the
Association was founded, and at last,
we have a champion.
[->]Which is great and all, but let's be
honest...
[->]What I'm really hoping for is a Tokyo
where we don't need one.
[END]
12: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403101]The Ashura−kai's confiscated almost all
the supplies from department stores
and malls.
[->]But those guys aren't so careful, so
there might be a few things left if you
come across any stores.
[END]
13: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403102]There used to be these things called the
”National Defense Divinities” in this
country.
[->]Before Tokyo was covered in bedrock,
it was a last−ditch plan...
[->]They were going to use powerful demons
as deadly weapons to counter invasions
from other countries.
[END]
14: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403102]Samurai and Hunters... We have pretty
similar roles.
[->]I'd rather think of Samurai as partners,
not competitors. What about you?
[END]
15: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there. Nice going, making it out
this far. Shinjuku's bad off enough to
need all the help we can get.
[->]If you're sure of yourself, will you
think about handling the matter of
the Corpses?
[END]
16: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there. Thanks for dealing with those
Corpses... You've got real promise.
[->]You seem pretty sure of yourself, so will
you think about taking care of the demon
at the Metropolitan Government Office?
[->]Talk to the Ashura−kai guy at the
shutters if you want to know more.
[END]
17: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, thanks for your hard work.
That business with the demon at the
government office made me think...
[->]It reminded me of the episode with the
sea monsters in that Ultra−something
show I saw once...
[->]Heh, what am I even talking about?
The point is, I'm thankful for what
you guys have done.
[END]
18: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, thanks for your hard work.
That business with the demon at the
government office made me think...
[->]It reminded me of the episode with the
sea monsters in that Ultra−something
show I saw once...
[->]Heh, what am I even talking about?
The point is, I'm thankful for what
you guys have done.
[END]
19: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]I've been hearing the name ”Eastern
Kingdom of Mikado” a lot lately.
[->]Looks like there's a few people from
there in Shinjuku too.
[->]If you run into any of them, make sure
you talk up the quests.
[END]
20: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, Samurai. That's a pretty
rare thing you've got.
[->]If you have one of those matchboxes,
it must mean Fujiwara wants to meet.
[->]You must be a big deal if you've caught
his attention...
[END]
21: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Lately, I've been seeing demons
everywhere in Shinjuku.
[->]They haven't shown any signs of making a
move on the underground districts yet...
[->]But it's unnerving to think that
Shinjuku's in the hands of demons now.
[END]
22: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, [Flynn]. Looks like
things are going pretty well for you.
[->]But a guy as strong as you, I'm sure
you can aim even higher.
[->]What you should try to do is make the
top three. You do that, and then this
tournament will really be something.
[END]
23: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, [Flynn]. Looks like
you've been keeping busy.
[->]Ever since you hit the top three,
folks have been talking about you.
[->]The other Hunters are starting to get
into the spirit of things too...
[->]Keep up the good work and help this
tournament really blow up.
[END]
24: (Bartender) [13 1, 405123]Hey, [Flynn]!
You've been on a roll!
[->]People have been talking about how you're
just a stone's throw from the champion's
title.
[->]The other Hunters are giving it all
they've got to keep up.
[->]So come on... you've come this far...
You're going for the championship,
right?
[END]
25: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, Tokyo's first champion.
You did good. Thanks to you, things
are picking up in Shinjuku.
[->]Though there's still cause for concern.
Like Armageddon between the angels of
the Firmament and the demons...
[->]There weren't many of them, but a few
demons have climbed the Sky Tower.
[END]
26: (Cynical man) [13 1, 403202]You must be [Flynn], right?
The one who's got Tokyo buzzing...
[->]Sorry if this seems sudden, but are you
interested in finding out what the people
around you think about you?
[END]
27: (斜に構えた男) ちょいと[優/やさ]しすぎて ハンター[稼業/かぎょう]を
やっていけるのか[心配/しんぱい]になるぜ
[END]
28: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a very
polite man.
[->]Which is an admirable trait, but a little
bizarre in Tokyo right now.
[END]
29: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a hard
man to get a handle on.
[->]I've met all kinds, but people like you
are pretty rare.
[END]
30: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a real
hot−blooded type.
[->]Just like almost everyone in Tokyo...
That's how you get if you live here
whether you like it or not.

32: (Cynical man) [13 1, 403202]You must be [Flynn], right?
Yeah, I've seen you around.
[->]Sorry if this seems sudden, but are you

around you think about you?
[END]
33: (斜に構えた男) この[東京/とうきょう]でお[前/まえ]ほどのカタブツは

[END]
34: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a very
polite man.
[->]I respect that, but here in this Tokyo...
It's pretty hard to stay that way.
[END]
35: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a hard
man to get a handle on.
[->]You go your own way, which is pretty
damn cool. Even though there aren't
many who would see things your way.
[END]
36: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a real
hot−blooded type.
[->]I don't know if you've always been like
that. It's just how you get if you live
here whether you like it or not.

[END]
38: (Cynical man) [13 1, 403202]Hey there, [Flynn]. Not a day
goes by that I don't hear about you.
[->]Sorry if this seems sudden, but are you
interested in finding out what the people
around you think about you?

39: (斜に構えた男) [法/ほう]と[秩序/ちつじょ]の[申/もう]し[子/ご]たるサムライだって
もはや[畏敬/いけい]の[象徴/しょうちょう]になってるぜ
[END]
40: (Cynical man) Everyone says you're a very polite man.
[->]Considering the state Tokyo is in, it's
rare that anyone like you still exists.
[END]
41: (Cynical man) Everyone says you're a hard man to get
a handle on.
[->]Which reminds me, there was another guy
I said the same thing to. He was a young
one too, about your age.
[END]
42: (Cynical man) Everyone says you're a real hot−blooded
type.
[->]The word is you're not from Tokyo, but
you've started to fit in even more than
some of the locals.

[END]
101: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403001]A long while ago, there was a rumor
going around that some big−time demons
went at it near Shinjuku National Park.
[->]It seems three angels from the ceiling
attacked Tokyo.
[->]But I guess they were weakened, because
they got taken down instead.
[END]
102: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403001]It seems like Fujiwara's staying out of
this spat between Tayama and Yuriko.
[->]All it would take would be for him to
give the word, and he could mobilize
Tokyo's top Hunters, too.
[->]He must be biding his time... waiting
for just the right opportunity.
[END]
107: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]I've carried Reds to Shinjuku National
Park for the Ashura−kai before.
[->]Back then, Shibuya was seriously hot.
It was a Red Paradise!
[->]...But no thanks to that guy, it's back
to being a normal city now.
[END]
108: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]It's natural that Tayama would have the
know−how to make Reds.
[->]You do know that they were ginned up by
a pharmaceutical company, right? One of
the Ashura−kai's dummy corporations.
[->]...This was all before the ceiling
showed up, even.
[END]
109: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]Hey, that [Flynn] guy... The pace
he's finishing those quests at is nuts!
[->]If he keeps this up, he might really
make champion...
[END]
119: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]You're one of those Samurai folks, right?
There was a Samurai here the other day...
[->]But he got taken away by some guys from
the Ashura−kai.
[END]
120: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]If you've been checking the bulletin
board's rankings, you've probably seen
the name ”Skins.”
[->]The man you met at Florida is Skins
himself.
[->]Not only is he strong, he's very good
at using his demons by now.
[->]He's not some random salaryman who up
and joined the Hunters. I'll bet you he
was specially trained somewhere.
[END]
125: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, Tokyo's first champion.
You did good. Thanks to you, things
are picking up in Shinjuku.
[->]Though there's still cause for concern.
Like Armageddon between the angels of
the Firmament and the demons...
[->]Of the Hunters who've gone off to
Ichigaya, word is that none of them
made it back alive.

126: ”I'm interested.”
”I've no interest.”

”I've no interest.”

207: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]I've carried Reds to Shinjuku National
Park for the Ashura−kai before.
[->]I picked 'em up from where they're made
and brought 'em to Shibuya.
[->]Man, where did I pick them up from...?
It's no use, I can't remember now.
[END]
208: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]This rumor about a ”reactor under
Ichigaya” is pretty rich. It's owned
by the military, actually.
[->]Some say it's a next−gen plasma weapon,
or that it's actually a ritual altar
to summon demons...
[->]They said all kinds of things about it
in those magazines even before the
ceiling formed.
[END]
219: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Tayama's mad that you went into one of
the Ashura−kai's forbidden zones.
[->]Not because you didn't listen to them,
but because it might cause others to
take the Ashura−kai less seriously.
[->]They have a fancy name now, but they're
really nothing but yakuza. Hits to their
reputation piss them off the most.
[END]
225: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]I have a large reservation under
Fujiwara's name.
[->]Looks like he's planning a reception
for VIPs from above the ceiling.
[->]I can't serve them demon meat... Ugh,
just thinking of a new menu makes my
head hurt.
[END]

0: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]The event they held at Club Milton
basically only invited demons...
[->]But if you do quests for the Ashura−kai,
they'll invite you sometimes too.
[->]It's a rare opportunity for us plain
folks to drink real booze.
[->]Throwing bones like that is one of the
smart ways Tayama has of doing things.
[END]
1: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403012]The war between the Ashura−kai and the
Ring of Gaea was a pillow fight compared
to what we got now...
[->]Tokyo's turned into a nest of demons.
And Reds have been showing up in Shibuya
as well...
[->]The way things are now, you never know
when the guy next to you might suddenly
turn into a demon!

3: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]Even if all the demons up and left, it
wouldn't change the fact that Tokyo is
dangerous...
[->]Reds have been going out all across
Tokyo from Shibuya, after all.
[->]There's all kinds of reasons to lose hope
and get desperate in times like these...
[->]And guys like that are likely to turn
into demons when you least expect it.
That's the situation we're in now.
[END]
4: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403112]Camp Ichigaya is a real dangerous place.
Who'd ever want to go near it?

place inside.

[END]
10: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403042]It makes sense that even Tayama had
trouble dealing with the demon who took
over Club Milton.
[->]It's supposedly a badass demon that was
being supervised by that... Counter−
something Force.
[END]
11: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403042]There's this topic that's come up in
our group before. What makes a skilled
Hunter?
[->]Someone who makes great stuff? Or one
who can win against strong demons?
Or an expert at fusion...?
[->]But now that this tournament is going on,
whoever takes first place is definitely
the most skilled Hunter, no question.
[END]
12: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403042]I went to Ichigaya the other day,
because there's supposedly a big−time
demon there...

intuition told me, without even going
inside...

out of my league...

careful you're not dragged into trouble.
[END]
14: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]You went beneath Roppongi, I hear?
Tell me, was there a weird demon
down there?

about trying for revenge on it.

that place beneath Roppongi is still

with customers.

behind might be what saves Tokyo...

200: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403012]Now that Koga Saburo's gone, Tayama's
taken back his base of operations for
supplying Reds.
[->]Yuriko seems confident in her victory
because of this ”son of carnage” who
she claims is coming.

resentment, so this might well be
the end of Tokyo...

210: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403042]After you defeated Koga Saburo, that
Ashura−kai guy went in to get something.

you need a special item to control...
[->]Think the Ashura−kai wants to take
control of Koga Saburo themselves?

211: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403041]Hey there, champion. Let me be the first
to congratulate you.
[->]You seem to have ties with Masakado
as well... Man, a Samurai who knows
the guardian of Tokyo...
[->]I'd say we were up against an unbeatable
opponent from the start.

213: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]...Hey there, guy. You met with Tayama,
right?

saw Koga Saburo.

of Shibuya.
[->]It was weird... He seemed even more
threatening than before for some reason.

313: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]...Hey there. You went beneath Roppongi,
I hear? They tell me you had a pretty
hard time of it there.

and come back alive.

you steer clear of there from now on.

1: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403042]I passed by Tsukiji Hongwanji a moment

champion.

was willing to help you.

5: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]You've even beaten that Demon Lord guy.
There's no one who could take you now.
[->]On top of that, you're the champion

of Tokyo...

you don't get taken advantage of by any
unsavory types, all right?

6: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403101]Have you ever been to Kasumigaseki?

useless in Tokyo today. Finders keepers,
right?

of the Counter−Demon Force or anything.
[->]I can't risk my life fighting demons...

8: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403141]Since you became champion, it seems like
the reputation of Hunters in general
has gotten a boost.

Hunter, but this... this isn't so bad.

11: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]There's a certain air about you...
You're one of those Samurai, no?

entrance test? We'll see how strong you
folks from above really are.

the southern passage and it'll be right
in front of you.

12: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]I heard that a kid about your age and
wearing clothes like yours headed for
Camp Ichigaya.

head toward Shibuya, and then keep going
north.
[->]Didn't they declare war on Yuriko, though?
I think that kid might be in danger...

13: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Looks like Tayama set up a defensive
line at the Sendagaya Tunnel...

[->]Take it from me and don't go anywhere
near the north of Shibuya.
[END]
14: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Looks like Yuriko's gone missing.
I thought those Ring of Gaea guys would
lose heart over that...
[->]But it was the total opposite. They're
all excited because some prophecy of
Yuriko's came true.
[->]Yuriko's cultivated an air of mystery by
not showing herself. She's got her cult
wrapped around her finger.
[END]
15: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, [Flynn]. Looks like
things are going pretty well for you.
[->]But a guy as strong as you, I'm sure
you can aim even higher.
[->]What you should try to do is make the
top three. You do that, and then this
tournament will really be something.
[END]
16: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, [Flynn]. Looks like
you've been keeping busy.
[->]Ever since you hit the top three,
folks have been talking about you.

into the spirit of things too...
[->]Keep up the good work and help this
tournament really blow up.
[END]
17: (Bartender) [13 1, 405123]Hey, [Flynn]!
You've been on a roll!
[->]People have been talking about how you're
just a stone's throw from the champion's
title.
[->]The other Hunters are giving it all
they've got to keep up.
[->]So come on... you've come this far...
You're going for the championship,
right?
[END]
18: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, Tokyo's first champion.
You did good. Thanks to you, things
are picking up in Ginza.
[->]Or, well... maybe not as much as some
other regions. I guess this is the
Ring of Gaea's turf, after all...
[->]Sure, they respect your achievements,
but they're still all about ”Lady
Yuriko.”

19: (Cynical man) [13 1, 403202]You must be [Flynn], right?

29: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a real

I said the same thing to. He was a young

I got frustrated over losing track of
my target demon.
[->]I−I hope he's a good sport...!
[END]
311: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]What's with the solemn looks? You two
look like you just ran away from home.
[->]...Huh? Seriously?
[->]But aren't you two in the Ring of Gaea?
Just go over to Tsukiji Hongwanji.

319: (Cynical man) I see... Then we'll leave it at that.

410: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]That huge boulder in the middle of the
intersection... That was Masakado, right?
[->]If you could get Masakado, the guardian
of Tokyo, on your side, you'd probably
be set for life.
[->]I bet even if the angels tried to pull
something, Masakado would put a stop
to it right quick.

bothered you.
[END]
7: (Cold man) [13 0, 76025]Alright... So in other words, you're
trying to get to the Counter−Demon
Force Base, right?

10: (Cold man) [13 0, 76029]There is this quest, though, called
”Peallaidh Extermination.” Why not
give that one a try?
[END]
11: (Cold man) [13 1, 403002]You're not from around here, so I'll tell
you where Shinobazu Pond is...
[->]When you leave here, head left. Then go
right at the end of the corridor and it's
at the exit of the underground passage.
[->]There's a dock at Shinobazu Pond. That's
where you'll find that damn Peallaidh...
[END]
13: (Wide−eyed man) [13 1, 403032]Huh? A guy with an icy stare? Are you...
Are you talking about Jun?
[->]Don't kid around. Jun got eaten
by Peallaidh.
[END]
14: (Wide−eyed man) [13 1, 403002]I talked to a guy who came out from Sky
Tower and he said he was from ”above
the ceiling.”
[->]I figured a story like that was out−
there enough that I owed him a drink.
[->]I mean, Medusa's in there, you know?
How many people you think she's turned
to stone over the years?
[END]
15: (Wide−eyed man) [13 1, 403032]Th−This might not be news to you, but I
just found out that Medusa... she's dead,
isn't she?
[->]Now someone called the ”Demon Lord” has
shown up in town. Tokyo's done for...
[->]But this is no time to panic. I'm going
up above the ceiling. I'm sure I'll be
saved if I can make it there!
[END]
16: (Wide−eyed man) [13 1, 403002]Yo, champion. Looks like that Demon Lord
guy was sent packing.
[->]There was a point where I thought about
abandoning Tokyo and escaping to the
place above the ceiling...
[->]But I couldn't do it. It's taken me all
this time, but I've realized how much
I love Tokyo...
[END]
17: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403101]Hunters are basically handymen. It's the
one job you can do in Tokyo that still
puts food on the table.
[->]We look for stuff all over Tokyo and risk
our lives to slay powerful demons.
[->]Of course, we don't do it unless the
reward's nice enough, either.
[END]
18: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403102]So how long have you been working as
a Hunter? Are you making a name for
yourself yet?
[->]People might be talking about you now.
[->]If you're curious about your rep, try
asking him... That guy back there.
[END]
19: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403122]I heard the Ashura−kai and Ring of Gaea
were going to war, so I was thinking
about my future prospects.
[->]But there are so many more demons now
that I just don't have the time. I don't
even know if I'll live through the day...
[END]
20: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403102]Ah, [Flynn]...!
[->]This might sound sudden, but are you
single? I'm a pretty good Hunter, and
I can cook what I catch...
[->]Believe me, I don't go around using
that line on anyone, okay?
[END]
21: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403102]Ah, [Flynn]...!
[->]When I was younger, I never even thought
about it, but after the demons came,
I was more conscious about dying...
[->]So I started giving my own future
prospects more thought.
[->]By the way... are you single?
[END]
22: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]There was a weird guy walking around the
underground district. He said he came
from the ”Eastern Kingdom of Mikado.”
[->]I felt so sorry for him that I had to
buy him a drink.
[->]I can understand how he feels, but we're
Tokyo citizens until the day we die...
[END]
23: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]The path to becoming the champion Hunter
is long and treacherous.
[->]You know the Challenge Quests issued to
the Hunters in each region of Tokyo?
[->]You have to complete them all to prove
you've got the skills.
[->]If someone actually pulls that off, then
yeah, they'd definitely be worthy of
the ”champion” title.
[END]
24: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]At first, when people were talking about
the power of hope, I thought it was just
silly idealism.
[->]But if that's the power that drove off
the angels... Maybe there's something
to it after all.
[END]
25: (Bartender) [13 1, 405124]If you're gonna try being a Hunter, then
you should go check out the black market.
[->]The stuff they handle there all has a
shady past, but there's no doubt that
it's quality merchandise.
[->]There's an old man who runs a stall in
the underground district, if you're
interested.
[END]
26: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]...Hey there, rookie. I heard you were
the one to kill Peallaidh.
[->]Your eyes tell me you don't intend on
staying in Ueno.
[->]I won't stop you from going wherever
you're going, but if you come by again,
do us a favor and pick up a few quests.
[END]
27: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]...Hey there. Looks like you've been out
all the way to Shinjuku. Did you stop by
the Association there too?
[->]The quests on the bulletin board are
different from region to region.
[->]So if you're ever in a new region for
the first time, you should hit up the
bulletin board at their Association.
[END]
28: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Ever since that weird pillar of light
appeared, demons have been pouring out
of Ichigaya...
[->]What with the sudden influx of demons,
the Hunters seem to have lost their
motivation lately.
[->]We need to think of a way to remedy
that...
[END]
29: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, [Flynn]. Looks like
things are going pretty well for you.
[->]But a guy as strong as you, I'm sure
you can aim even higher.
[->]What you should try to do is make the
top three. You do that, and then this
tournament will really be something.
[END]
30: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, [Flynn]. Looks like
you've been keeping busy.
[->]Ever since you hit the top three,
folks have been talking about you.
[->]The other Hunters are starting to get
into the spirit of things too...
[->]Keep up the good work and help this
tournament really blow up.
[END]
31: (Bartender) [13 1, 405123]Hey, [Flynn]!
You've been on a roll!
[->]People have been talking about how you're
just a stone's throw from the champion's
title.
[->]The other Hunters are giving it all
they've got to keep up.
[->]So come on... you've come this far...
You're going for the championship,
right?
[END]
32: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, Tokyo's first champion.
You did good. Everyone I talk to in
Ueno has nothing but praise for you.
[->]Your deeds have given the people of
Ueno... or actually, everyone in
Tokyo, renewed hope.
[->]To think that the rookie who didn't even
know about bulletin boards would make
it all the way to the top!
[END]
33: (Cynical man) [13 1, 403202]You must be [Flynn], right?
The one who's got Tokyo buzzing...
[->]Sorry if this seems sudden, but are you
interested in finding out what the people
around you think about you?

[END]
35: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a very
polite man.
[->]Which is an admirable trait, but a little
bizarre in Tokyo right now.
[END]
36: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a hard
man to get a handle on.
[->]I've met all kinds, but people like you
are pretty rare.
[END]
37: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a real
hot−blooded type.

Yeah, I've seen you around.
[->]Sorry if this seems sudden, but are you

around you think about you?
[END]
40: (斜に構えた男) この[東京/とうきょう]でお[前/まえ]ほどのカタブツは

[END]
41: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a very
polite man.
[->]I respect that, but here in this Tokyo...
It's pretty hard to stay that way.
[END]
42: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a hard
man to get a handle on.
[->]You go your own way, which is pretty
damn cool. Even though there aren't
many who would see things your way.
[END]
43: (Cynical man) Most people seem to think you're a real
hot−blooded type.
[->]I don't know if you've always been like
that. It's just how you get if you live
here whether you like it or not.

[END]
45: (Cynical man) [13 1, 403202]Hey there, [Flynn]. Not a day
goes by that I don't hear about you.
[->]Sorry if this seems sudden, but are you
interested in finding out what the people
around you think about you?

[END]
47: (Cynical man) Everyone says you're a very polite man.
[->]Considering the state Tokyo is in, it's
rare that anyone like you still exists.
[END]
48: (Cynical man) Everyone says you're a hard man to get
a handle on.
[->]Which reminds me, there was another guy
I said the same thing to. He was a young
one too, about your age.
[END]
49: (Cynical man) Everyone says you're a real hot−blooded
type.
[->]The word is you're not from Tokyo, but
you've started to fit in even more than
some of the locals.

51: (Burroughs) [7a 2][13 1, 400005]Hold on, you have a different quest
going on right now. Are you sure you
want to continue?
[END]
52: If you wish to proceed with the main
quest, you must abandon or complete the
the Challenge Quest in order to release
the hold placed on the main quest.
[END]
108: (Burroughs) [13 0, 86020]This seems like important evidence.
I'll make a note of it in the quest.
[END]
111: (Cold man) [13 0, 76033]Heh, the Counter−Demon Force...
There's something I haven't heard
about in a long time.
[END]
114: (Wide−eyed man) [13 1, 403002]I've been seeing that guy from ”above
the ceiling” more lately.
[->]I asked the Ashura−kai about it, and all
they said was ”You mean past Medusa?”
[->]Considering the state of Tokyo these
days, I wouldn't blame him for losing
touch with reality.
[END]
115: (Wide−eyed man) [13 1, 403032]Huh? The champion? What good's that
going to do you?
[->]Now someone called the ”Demon Lord” has
shown up in town. Tokyo's done for...
[->]But this is no time to panic. I'm going
up above the ceiling. I'm sure I'll be
saved if I can make it there!
[END]
118: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403122]If you're a Hunter too, then you must be
in the same bind I am.
[->]After what just happened, I've been
thinking about whether to side with
Tayama or Yuriko.
[->]So weird to be worrying about the future
even in this demon−infested hellhole...
[END]
119: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403122]The Ashura−kai and the Ring of Gaea are
both gone. So what should I do about
the future...?
[->]Well, maybe I'll give that Hunter
tournament a try.
[->]I might be able to do some networking
with the top−ranked Hunters, after all.
[END]
122: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403012]Guys who go around armed like us Hunters
must be a pain for the Ashura−kai...
[->]But the Association bartenders have it
all under control. They kick a little
back to the Ashura−kai under the table.
[END]
127: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]...Hey there. I heard you've been out
all the way to Ikebukuro. Do you know
about the Association there?
[->]They got attacked by demons and had to
close down. So don't expect to get any
work there.
[->]On the bright side, since Hunters don't
go here anymore, you can probably find
some nice, rare items.
[END]
132: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]Hey there, Tokyo's first champion.
You really did an amazing job...
[->]The Association will probably have a lot
of time on its hands now. Though that's
really something to celebrate...
[END]
133: ”I'm interested.”
”I've no interest.
[END]
139: ”I'm interested.”
”I've no interest.”
[END]
145: ”I'm interested.”
”I've no interest.”
[END]
208: (Cold man) [13 0, 76027]But the Ashura−kai has destroyed most
of the bridges across Tokyo. Getting
across the river won't be so simple.
[->][13 0, 76029]There is this quest, though, called
”Peallaidh Extermination.” Why not
give that one a try?
[END]
214: (Wide−eyed man) [13 1, 403002]I hear Yuriko's been saying some strange
stuff. Something about people coming
from above the ceiling...?
[->]But the Ashura−kai have Medusa blocking
the entrance at Sky Tower.
[->]I don't think Yuriko knows what she's
talking about. You know what I mean?
[END]
215: (Wide−eyed man) [13 1, 403002]Yo, champion. As long as you're here,
Tokyo's peace is guaranteed.
[->]Medusa's gone too, so you're the only
one who can protect Tokyo now.
[->]I thought about escaping to the above
world through Sky Tower, but in the end,
I couldn't abandon Tokyo...
[END]
219: (Hunter woman) [13 1, 403102]The Ashura−kai and the Ring of Gaea are
both gone. So what should I do about
the future...?
[->]For the moment, I'm participating in that
Hunter tournament. I've been networking
a little with the top−ranked Hunters.
[->]The one I'm watching right now is
[Flynn]. I definitely want to
get to know him...
[END]
227: (Bartender) [13 1, 405120]You've been to Ginza? Then you might
already know this...
[->]But flashing a VIP card to parade
through the streets of Ginza sounds
pretty stylin'.
[->]To get that far, though, you'll need the
kind of cash reserves that'd make a man's
eyes bulge out.
[END]
233: (Cynical man) Then hear me out...
[END]
239: (Cynical man) Then hear me out...

308: 〉 The cold man takes something from his
pocket and fiddles with it...

stuff. Something about people coming
from above the ceiling...?
[->]But the Ashura−kai have Medusa blocking
the entrance at Sky Tower.
[->]Y−Yuriko doesn't get it at all. Medusa
will turn absolutely anyone to stone...
[END]
315: (Wide−eyed man) [13 1, 403002]Yo, champion. As long as you're here,
Tokyo's peace is guaranteed.
[->]Although that ”Demon Lord” is still
around, isn't he? Should I try escaping
through Sky Tower after all...?
[->]...Nah. I can't leave Tokyo behind.

333: (Cynical man) I see... Then we'll leave it at that.

America and China are dealing with the
same thing anyway.
[END]
7: (Hunter man) [13 1, 403002]We can't begin the restoration if we're
starving to death! We need to secure a
food supply first.

other countries, I guess we'll have to
get self−sufficient.

will have to be produced domestically...
All for the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado!

that list.

34: (Mido) [7a 0]After choosing the resulting demon,
select a combination of component

their [Color:0x5]skills[Color:0x0] and the [Color:0x5]demons currently
at your side.[Color:0x0]

demons and the makeup of your party after
the fusion are both important factors.
[->]Keep these thoughts in mind as you
select your component demons.

35: (Mido) [7a 0]Once you have a resulting demon and its

37: (Mido) [7a 0]You may specify demons you are adamant

as components in order to create even
more powerful allies...

usefulness to you and you wish to wring
one final use from it...
[->]There are good reasons why you may wish
to set this condition.
[->][END]
38: (Mido) [7a 0]You may specify demons as off limits from
being used as a component in the fusion.
[->]Perhaps you wish to keep a demon who has

to set this condition.

40: (Mido) [7a 0]This will display only demons that you

of the demon you will create.
[->]However, you cannot specify a race from
which you have never encountered any
representatives before.

registered with Analyze can be specified.
[->]It can be useful if you know you will
need a demon of a specific race for
a later fusion.
[->][END]
42: (Mido) [7a 0]This allows you to specify an individual
demon to create.
[->]However, you cannot specify a demon which
you've never encountered before.

registered with Analyze can be specified.
[->]Only the most discerning summoners
will find this condition of use...
[->][END]
43: (Mido) [7a 0]You can specify the types of skills you
wish the resulting demon to have.
[->]If you are looking for a demon to play
a particular role, such as strking enemy
weaknesses, or support and healing...
[->]You may find this condition useful.
[->][END]
44: (Mido) [7a 0]You can specify individual skills you
wish the resulting demon to have.
[->]However, you cannot specify a skill which
you have never seen put to use before.
[->]If your own party has used it, or it has
been used against you, that is another
matter.
[->]This is a helpful condition if you
wish to build your demons in a very
specific way.
[->][END]
45: (Mido) [7a 0]You can specify elements that you require
the resulting demons to be resistant to.
[->]For example, if you specify Fire or Ice
as your condition...
[->]The search will return demons who Resist,
Null, Repel, or Drain that element.
[->]This condition can be invaluable if
you are building a force to combat
troublesome foes.
[->][END]
46: (Mido) [7a 0]This will allow you to use demons
registered in the Compendium for
components as well.
[->]In other words, component demons which
you do not have on hand can be summoned
directly into the fusion.
[->]The same amount of Macca is required to
summon them, so mind your finances.
[->]This condition can increase the
possibilities in fusion tremendously.
[->]And it will increase the number of
results in a search commensurately, so
you must narrow it down by other means.
[->]The broad range of possibilities that
this condition opens is fit only for
experts.
[->][END]
47: (Mido) [7a 0]This allows you to omit Elements from the
component demons.
[->]Should you include Elements in the
search, it can cause a tremendous
increase in the number of results...
[->]Should you run afoul of this, use this
condition to narrow your search.
[->][END]
48: (Mido) [7a 0]The Demon Compendium is a grimoire that
contains the details of your demons.
[->]Not only can you view the demons you

[->]As you meet more demons, the Demon
Compendium will become an important
tool in your journey.

49: (Mido) [7a 0]To view the Demon Compendium, access the
Cathedral of Shadows' main menu...

list and examine their details to your
heart's content.
[->]You may also press [button 0] here to summon

[->]This is an extremely useful feature,

[->]Take care that you use it deliberately
so as not to find yourself penniless.
[->][END]
50: (Mido) [7a 0]As you develop your demons, they will
begin to diverge from their entries in
the Demon Compendium.
[->]When this happens, you may register the
demon's current details in the Compendium,
overwriting its previous information.
[->]To do so, first go to the Cathedral of
Shadows' main menu...
[->]Select Demon Compendium, and then
Register.
[->]The resulting list will contain demons
whose current state diverges from their
recorded Compendium details.
[->]Select a demon and press [button 0] to
record the new details.
[->]You may also press [button 131072] to record all of
the demons' updated details at once.
[->][END]
51: (Mido) [7a 0]When updating the records in your Demon
Compendium, there is one thing to be
cautious of.
[->]Take care that a stronger version of a
demon in the Compendium is not displaced
by the weak one in your party.
[->]For example, you might use a well−
developed demon in fusion, eliminating
it from your stock.
[->]If you happened to befriend that same
demon through conversation again...
[->]The demon would be in its initial state,
putting you at risk of running afoul
of the case I mentioned.
[->]When you are considering whether or not
to update the records, press [button 196608] on the
register screen.
[->]This will display the demon's current
state and its Compendium record one
after another for easy comparison.
[->][END]
52: (Mido) [7a 0]Summoning from the Demon Compendium
requires a certain amount of Macca.
[->]It may interest you to know that the
summoning fee is dependent on the
recorded demon's quality.
[->]HP, MP, its statistics, elemental
affinities, and known skills are all
factors in determining the price.
[->]The stronger the demon, the higher the
cost of summoning it will be.
[->]Whether you opt for strength or savings
will pose quite a dilemma.
[->][END]
53: (Mido) [7a 0]”The record in the Compendium is too
strong! I can't afford the high cost of
summoning!”
[->]There are many users who express such
concerns, so allow me to tell you one
way to bypass this thorny problem.
[->]It's quite simple. All you have to do
is purposely replace the record with
a weaker version of the demon.
[->]Befriend a demon through conversation
to gain it in its initial state, and then
register that state to the Compendium.
[->]Employing this technique is counter to
the warning given elsewhere, but it
definitely has its uses.
[->][END]
54: (Mido) [7a 0]There are a series of laws that govern
demon fusion.
[->]What kind of demon the resulting demon
becomes is decided by the laws of
fusion, for instance.
[->]It is, of course, entirely possible to
fuse demons without knowing these laws...
[->]But it is best to be aware of them to
some extent to perform more refined
fusions.
[->][END]
55: (Mido) [7a 0]The race of the resulting demon depends
on which component demons are fused.
[->]For example, fusing race [Color:0x1]A[Color:0x0] with race [Color:0x1]B[Color:0x0]
will result in race [Color:0x1]C,[Color:0x0] and so forth.
[->]It is most useful to be conscious of this
law if you are seeking to fuse a demon
of a particular race.
[->]If you wish to make a demon of race [Color:0x1]C,[Color:0x0]
you will need component demons of races
[Color:0x1]A[Color:0x0] and [Color:0x1]B...[Color:0x0]
[->]With the reverse lookup, you can figure
out which races of component demon
to use.
[->][END]
56: (Mido) [7a 0]The resulting demon's level is decided
by the level of the component demons.
[->]The formula dictates that the averaged
level of the component demons is the
basis for the resulting demon's level.
[->]A strong demon is born from strong demons.
A weak demon is born from weak demons.
[->]It only stands to reason...
[->][END]
57: (Mido) [7a 0]If a component demon has gained any
levels, you must take care when
calculating the fusion result.
[->]This is because the formula dictated by
the laws of fusion...
[->]...takes only the component demon's
initial level into account, rather than
any it has accrued through experience.
[->]Even if you fused a Foul Slime at level
99, it would result in a very weak demon.
[->]It's important to remember that the
demon's initial strength is what
matters, not its current strength.
[->][END]
58: (Mido) [7a 0]Of the many races of demons, do you know
the idiosyncracies of the Elements?
[->]This Element race has a special and
rather technical role in fusion.
[->]It gets a bit complicated to explain,
but using them in fusions can greatly
influence your results.
[->]If you are confident in your skills,
you should by all means make an effort
to learn their use.
[->][END]
59: (Mido) [7a 0]To create an Element, simply fuse two
demons of the same race together.
[->]Which Element results from the fusion
is determined by the race of the
component demons used.
[->]If there is a specific Element you wish
to create, then narrow down your search
to the races that can create it...
[->]And then fuse two demons of that race
together.
[->][END]
60: (Mido) [7a 0]In order to understand an Element's
effect on fusion, you must first
understand the concept of ”ranks.”
[->]Rank is the order of each demon's level
within the same race.
[->]For example, if there were a demon [Color:0x1]A[Color:0x0]
of level 20...
[->]Within this race, you would look for
a higher−level demon than [Color:0x1]A.[Color:0x0]
[->]It happens that demon [Color:0x1]B,[Color:0x0] of level 25,
is the first one you find.
[->]In this case, demon [Color:0x1]B[Color:0x0] would be one rank
higher than demon [Color:0x1]A.[Color:0x0]
[->]Conversely, you could also say that
demon [Color:0x1]A[Color:0x0] is one rank lower than demon [Color:0x1]B.[Color:0x0]
[->][END]
61: (Mido) [7a 0]An Element's role in fusion is in essence
to manipulate the rank of your component
demons.
[->]For example, if you fused a certain
Element with demon [Color:0x1]A...[Color:0x0]
[->]The result would be a demon of [Color:0x1]A[Color:0x0]'s race,
but one rank above or below [Color:0x1]A.[Color:0x0]
[->]This amounts to manipulating [Color:0x1]A[Color:0x0]'s rank.
[->]Whether the rank increases or decreases
depends on [Color:0x1]A[Color:0x0]'s race, as well as the
Element fused with it.
[->]There would seem to be many combinations
where fusion is not possible...
[->]Learn well the web of compatibility
between the races and Elements.
[->][END]
62: (Mido) [7a 0]Demon fusions essentially follow certain
laws and proceed systematically...
[->]But very rarely, unexpected errors may
crop up during this process.
[->]When this happens, the resulting demon
will not be what you had planned for.
[->]...Even I have yet to figure out why such
a thing occurs.
[->]I highly doubt that there are any bugs
in the Cathedral of Shadows' code...
[->]Perhaps some mysterious power, unknown
even to me, is at play.
[->][END]
63: (Mido) [7a 0]Special fusion is a unique process where
the component demons are predetermined.
[->]These fusions are only possible through
specific combinations.
[->]That is why many of the demons created
through special fusion tend to be special
themselves.
[->]Try experimenting to see what kinds of
special fusions you can perform.
[->][END]
64: (Mido) [7a 0]There are four main ways in which special
fusion differs from normal fusion.
[->]First, the normal laws of fusion do
not apply.
[->]Second, the process is not limited to
only two component demons. It may
involve three or even four at times.
[->]Third, demons created through special
fusion cannot be created in any other
way.
[->]Not through normal fusion, and not
through fusion accidents.
[->]Fourth, even if the component demons
are the same, the resulting demon will
be different in a special fusion.
[->]For example, if demon [Color:0x1]A[Color:0x0] and demon [Color:0x1]B[Color:0x0]
fuse to create demon [Color:0x1]C[Color:0x0] through special
fusion...
[->]You would not get demon [Color:0x1]C[Color:0x0] by fusing
demon [Color:0x1]A[Color:0x0] and demon [Color:0x1]B[Color:0x0] in normal fusion.
[->]Remember these four points well...
[->][END]
65: (Mido) [7a 0]To use the special fusion feature,
first access the Cathedral of Shadows'
main menu...
[->]Then select Fusion and, from there,
Special Fusion.
[->][END]
66: (Mido) [7a 0]For special fusions, you first select the
demon you wish to create from the list.
[->]Once you have selected it, press [button 0] to
review which component demons the fusion
requires.
[->]By the way, there is one condition for
that demon to appear on the list...
[->]You must have befriended at least one
of its component demons in the past.
[->]You may wish to check the special fusion
list often as you befriend new demons.
[->][END]
67: (Mido) [7a 0]After deciding on the demon you wish to
create, check which component demons are
required for the fusion.
[->]At this time, component demons not
present in your stock will be supplied
automatically from the Compendium.
[->]After reviewing the combination, press
[button 0] to move on to your final check.
[->]Finally, press [button 0] once more to perform
the fusion.
[->][END]
68: (Mido) [7a 0]When performing special fusions, you may
come across demons listed as ”???”.
[->]This indicates that the demon's identity
is not yet known.
[->]If the resulting demon is listed as
???”, it means that not all of the
component demons have been acquired yet.
[->]If a component demon is listed as ”???”,
it means you have not yet befriended
that demon in some way.
[->]Despite this, the demon's race and level
will be legible, which should provide a
hint toward acquiring that demon.
[->][END]
69: (Mido) [7a 0]Fusion conditions show that a demon is
not currently available to be fused.
[->]Even if you are of an appropriate level,
and in possession of the right component
demons...
[->]Unless the fusion conditions are met,
you will be unable to create that demon.
[->]What this means in practice is...
[->]The Fusion Search does not reflect all
possible results. Special fusions will
not appear on the list.
[->]Their very existence is hidden.
[->]...Even I am not sure why this occurs.
I am currently looking into it.
[->][END]
70: (Mido) [7a 0]It seems that there are two ways to meet
fusion conditions.
[->]One is to fight the demon and defeat it.
[->]The other is to somehow enlist that
demon's help.
[->]Either way... you must make the demon
accept you as its master.
[->][END]
71: (Mido) [7a 0]There is an App that extends the
Cathedral of Shadows to allow you to
fuse demons even during battle.
[->]By installing the ”Fusion Lite” App on
Burroughs, you will gain access to this
functionality.
[->]However, since the Gauntlet is occupied
with various other processes during
battle...
[->]Only the simplest, most minimal functions
are enabled, so as not to overexert it.
[->]It permits a quick fusion between two
demons on hand. Skill inheritance is
handled automatically.
[->]This may seem to compare poorly with
the more fully−featured version...
[->]But the ability to fuse during battle
will surely open up new strategic
possibilities.
[->][END]
72: (Mido) [7a 0]The Cathedral of Shadows app... This is
the masterpiece I spent my life crafting.
[->]It is the ultimate demon App that allows
the user full control of all things
related to demons.
[->]From the ritual of demon fusion to
various functions to control demons...
[->]This App is your gateway to the
mesmerizing world of demons.
[->]I hope that you use it to the fullest.
[->][END]
73: (Mido) [7a 0]What are you asking me now? I am Mido,
master of this Cathedral of Shadows app.
[->]If you wish to know more, well...
[->]I am a man who grew fascinated by
demons, and as a result, ended up
as a digital entity...
[->]...That much I don't mind telling you.
[->][END]
74: (Strange man) [13 0, 900000]Welcome to the Cathedral of Shadows,

75: (Strange man) [13 0, 900001]Ah, you must be a new user.
Congratulations on activating
this application.

79: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 900007]Many things are possible in the
Cathedral of Shadows, but the most
important of them is demon fusion.
[->][13 0, 900008]Demon fusion is a forbidden process
wherein multiple demons are fused
together to create a new demon.
[->][13 0, 900009]To perform demon fusion, select
[Color:0x5]”Demon Fusion”[Color:0x0] from the menu.
[->][END]
80: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 900010]An astounding variety of demons can
be created through fusion...
[->][13 0, 900011]Which is why I have prepared a useful
function called [Color:0x5]”Fusion Search.”[Color:0x0]
[->][13 0, 900012]This will allow you to search by
categories such as race, performance,
and skills to fuse your desired demon.
[->][END]
81: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 900013]I would recommend that beginners
simply perform a search without
changing any of the parameters.
[->][13 0, 900014]Doing so will display a list of demons
you are currently capable of fusing.
[->][13 0, 900015]If any of them catch your interest,
go ahead and fuse them.
[->][13 0, 900016]Once you get the hang of it, then you
can try adjusting some of the search
conditions.
[->][END]
82: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 900017]Now, apart from that, I've actually
prepared one other method of fusion
that's very basic.
[->][13 0, 900018]Look at those rows directly above
the menu. Do you see the icons with
demon faces?
[->][13 0, 900019]That is the ultimate time−saving
function... I call it [Color:0x5]”Recommended
Fusions.”[Color:0x0]
[->][13 0, 900020]It lists the top three demons you can
currently fuse, hand−picked by me.
[->][13 0, 900021]If any of them pique your interest,
you can select it and fuse it at once.
[->][13 0, 900022]You can be particular with the Fusion
Search or take the simple route of
Recommended Fusions.

[->][END]
83: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 900017]Now, apart from that, I've actually

[->][END]
84: [13 1, 903002]Unfortunately, there are no demons that
can be fused right now.
[->][13 1, 903001]When the tutorial is done, gather more
demons so that you can fuse them.
[->][13 1, 903004]Should you do so, Mido will make fusion
recommendations here...

[->][END]
86: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 900024]One last thing... I should say a few
words about the [Color:0x5]”Demon Compendium.”[Color:0x0]
[->][13 0, 900025]The Demon Compendium is a grimoire
where your demons' data is recorded.
[->][13 0, 900026]Not only can you view the data for the
demons you have fused or befriended...
[->][13 0, 900027]You can also summon those demons in
exchange for Macca.

use you will get out of the Compendium.
[->][END]
87: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 900029]That concludes my lessons.
[->][13 0, 900030]If you want to learn more about

96: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 901001]By the way, you seem to have handled
a startling number of quests so far.
[->][13 0, 901002]What? How can I know such a thing?
[->][13 0, 901003]Why, it's quite obvious if I look into
your Gauntlet's data.

97: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 901005]That aside, about those quests...
[->][13 0, 901006]I'd like to request one of you myself.
[->][13 0, 901007]I want you to assist me in my research
on demons.
[->][13 0, 901008]I cannot offer much, but there will
be a reward as well. Not a bad deal,
is it?
[->][END]
98: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 901009]Thank you for taking the time to speak
with me. I actually have another
request for you.
[->][END]
99: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 901010]The details...? Well, it's something
along these lines.
[->][13 0, 901011]Let me transfer the data to Burroughs
right now.
[->][END]
100: (Burroughs) [13 0, 901012]Mido passed along some data.
I'll register it as a quest.
[->][END]
101: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 901013]All right, I'll be counting on you.
I expect excellent results.
[->][END]
102: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 901014]Is the request I gave you going
smoothly?
[->][END]
103: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 901015]Hm... it doesn't seem like you have
what I specified yet.
[->][13 0, 901016]Well, all I ask is that you continue
trying.
[->][END]
104: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 901017]Ah, it would seem that you have what
I specified.
[->][END]
105: (Mido) [7a 0][13 0, 901018]Hm, this is a fine report. Very useful
data. It will do a great deal for my
research...
[->][13 0, 901019]I hope you'd be willing to pitch in
again if something were to come up.
[->][END]
106: (Mido) [7a 0]This Cathedral of Shadows is stored on
a server. The Gauntlet acts as a terminal
to access it.
[->]In essence, all of Mikado's Samurai are
Cathedral of Shadows users.
[->]This year, you and four other new users
have been registered...
[->]Walter, Jonathan, Isabeau, Navarre,
and [Flynn]...
[->]I look forward to working with these
five new Samurai.
[->][END]
107: (Mido) [7a 0]If there is anything you don't understand
about fusion, you may ask me.
[->]Select a topic from the list below and
I will give you as clear an answer as
I am able.
[->]After you have digested what I have to
teach, all that's left is to fuse and
keep fusing...
[->]Experience is the greatest teacher,
after all.
[->][END]
108: (Mido) [7a 0]Once you grow accustomed to normal
fusion, try attempting special fusions.
[->]Demons created through special fusion
are generally quite strong...
[->]They will be reassuring allies when you
face powerful enemies.
[->][END]
109: (Mido) [7a 0]What was your initial reaction when
you saw Tokyo? Isn't it truly vast?
[->]There are many demons unknown to you
lurking in this land.
[->]Which means it is all the more abundant
in components for fusion...
[->]The Cathedral of Shadows will be your
oyster now! Hahahahahaha...
[->][END]
110: (Mido) [7a 0]As you face stronger demons, support
skills will play a more vital role.
[->]If you see a support skill in the list
of skills to inherit, you should think
carefully about what to keep.
[->]Are you certain you won't need that
support skill? Might you come to regret
that decision later?
[->]Give careful thought to such questions
when fusing...
[->][END]
111: (Mido) [7a 0]How many skill slots do your demons
have as yet?
[->]Your demons' skills will surely be
more abundant going forward.
[->]How many of these skills they can hold
at a time will be dependant on the
number of skill slots you provide.
[->]Whether or not to purchase more skill
slots for your demons is certainly
something to consider...
[->][END]
112: (Mido) [7a 0]Have you been making use of special
fusions?
[->]There are a limited number available
at first, but I'm sure the list has
become quite substantial now.
[->]If the component demons are unknown,
it can be diverting to try and guess
what they might be.
[->]Discovering the components, fusing the
special demons, and deploying their
strength in battle...
[->]Special fusion can be rewarding indeed.
[->][END]
113: (Mido) [7a 0]Have you experimented with using Elements
in your fusions?
[->]Manipulating rank with Elements is the
most straightforward way to strengthen
a demon.
[->]It does require some care. You must
understand the laws governing it and
prepare the proper Elemental...
[->]But the reward for taking such pains
will surely be significant.
[->]If ever you find yourself needing such
an ally, give it a try.
[->][END]
114: (Mido) [7a 0]I assume your Demon Compendium must
be quite substantial by now.
[->]Try allowing demons in your Compendium
to be used in fusion searches.
[->]You may be shocked at the expanded range
of possibilities that will result. You
could call it explosive...
[->]But then, the vast range of possibilities
could also prove overwhelming for you.
[->]Use your own judgement in setting your
conditions for a fusion search.
[->][END]
115: (Mido) [7a 0]The enemy demons will only be stronger
from this point on.
[->]It may be time to have your demons
specialize in a particular role, such as
attackers, supporters, or healers.
[->]You could also create well−rounded
demons, but you run the risk of them
falling short at a critical moment.
[->]The kind of demons you create will be
the true proof of your skills.
[->][END]
116: (Mido) [7a 0]You don't even understand your situation,
yet even so, you want to fuse demons...
[->]Amazing! That is how a true user of the
Cathedral of Shadows App should behave!
[->][END]
117: (Mido) [7a 0]The digital world where I live is
connected to all places.
[->]Thus, there is no difficulty in using
the Cathedral of Shadows App even from
the Tokyo you find yourself in now.
[->]Pay no mind to these trifling matters
and concentrate on your fusions as
usual.
[->][END]
118: (Mido) [7a 0]Have you encountered any fusion accidents
thus far?
[->]Fusion accidents are essentially a
flawed fusion resulting in an unforeseen
demon...
[->]However, they will sometimes result in
rare demons that cannot normally be
created through fusion.
[->]What starts as an unfortunate accident
could become a happy stroke of luck...
[->]This is one of the things that makes
fusion so mesmerizing.
[->][END]
119: (Mido) [7a 0]Your battle has reached its climax now...
The highest class of demons will be
making its appearances soon.
[->]Though I call it the highest class,
it contains quite a number of demons.
[->]Are you up to the challenge of creating
the best demons from within this
exalted class?
[->][END]
120: (Mido) [7a 0]You seem to have accomplished a great
mission.
[->]It is all thanks to your fusion of
steadfast demons through the Cathedral
of Shadows app.
[->]Knowing that it gave you the power to
change the world, I'm ready to call it
my true masterpiece.
[->]Hahahahaha...
[->][END]
